### CCA Leaders

Our CCA leaders work closely with the CCA teachers-in-charge and instructors/coaches in the planning and execution of the CCA programme. They work closely with members to achieve CCA-specific goals. They play an important role in upholding discipline and forge camaraderie amongst members.

To ensure that our student leaders are well-equipped to take on their appointments, our CCA teachers-in-charge incorporate the necessary leadership training and mentoring into the overall CCA programme.
