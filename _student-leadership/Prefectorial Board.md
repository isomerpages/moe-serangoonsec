### Prefectorial Board

**Our Vision:**

Students who develop their potential and strive for possibilities; Leaders who serve people

**Our Pledge:**

We, the prefects of Serangoon Secondary School

Promise to uphold the three pillars of the Prefectorial Board

To inculcate willpower, responsibility and honesty

To carry out our duties with our heart, soul and mind

For the progression of our school

To mould character, ignite passion and build community

In Serangoon Secondary School, we seek to develop our prefects as:

- **Committed leaders**, who work for the good of others and the growth of self.
- **Lifelong learners**, with a passionate heart to serve.
- **United leaders**, who work together to achieve a common goal for the school.
- **Willing individuals**, standing together for the good of the school.

Students who display strong leadership potential and contribute actively to the school and in the classroom in Secondary 1 are selected and invited to join the Prefectorial Board in Serangoon Secondary School as Trainee Prefects. They are nominated by their peers, teachers and school staff who interact with them on a daily basis.

Trainee Prefects will be mentored by their seniors to prepare them for their future roles and responsibilities, and trainee prefects who have successfully completed their year of traineeship will be invested at the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture.

In Secondary 3, our prefects will be promoted to Senior Prefects. Outstanding Senior Prefects will be nominated and invited by the Prefectorial Board Leadership Team to serve in the Prefect EXCO. The Prefect EXCO plans and coordinates with teachers to lead the Board and fulfil the Board’s main duties.

The Prefectorial Board plays a key role to ensure the daily smooth running of the school such as Morning Assembly and maintaining order during Recess. Prefects are on duty for most functions and events in school as well. In addition, the Prefectorial Board plans and executes key events in the school such as the Secondary 1 Orientation and Teachers’ Day Celebrations and acts as a voice of the student body for their welfare.

Find out more from our Head Prefect, Ng Jia Le (2021 Sec 4N7) on what leadership means to him.
