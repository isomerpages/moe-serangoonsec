### Peer Support Leaders

Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) reside within the class but their influence extends beyond the classroom. They contribute to build a caring and enabling environment through:

• Peer Bonding: fostering bonds and belonging to the school community

• Peer Helping: providing practical help and social-emotional support

• Peer Influencing: influencing mindsets and behaviours, advocating for well-being and role-modelling good character

By building a strong culture of Peer Support, PSLs bridge the adult-student divide and are powerful channels of positive influence for student voice and empowerment. This facilitates the provision of care, sense of belonging and building of resilience.
