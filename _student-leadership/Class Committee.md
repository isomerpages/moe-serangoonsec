Our Class Committee Leaders contribute towards building a positive classroom culture by:

- exercising the responsibility of maintaining good order in the class and school.
- organising and leading the class in the various class activities and school functions.
- co-operating with the Form and Subject Teachers to ensure that lessons run smoothly and effective teaching and learning takes place.
