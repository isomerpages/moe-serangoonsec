### Overview

##### Training and Development

Our students are provided with training at different levels to enable them to be effective in their leadership role. Students who aspire to take on key leadership positions will be invited to participate in the annual Student Leadership Training Workshop.

Student leaders will receive training for their specific roles. For example, for CCA leaders, leadership training is infused into their CCAs; while for subject representatives, they will be mentored by their respective subject teachers.

Student leaders can also look forward to opportunities to attend leadership workshops and organise key school events such as the Sec 1 Orientation Day, Student Leaders’ Investiture, Teachers’ Day Celebrations.
