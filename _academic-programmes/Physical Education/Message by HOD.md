At Serangoon Secondary School, we believe in and are committed to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly. Play is an essential part of Physical Education (PE), but PE is not “just play”. Movement is fundamental to PE, and is used as a means to facilitate students holistic development through learning in movement, learning about movement and learning through movement.

Through interaction with the physical and social environments, our students’ learning and desired behaviour are strengthened. On top of learning skills and knowledge related to physical activities, outdoor education and physical health and safety, PE provides an authentic platform where students develop core values and social-emotional competencies. During individual and group activities, students learn to be resilient by not giving up easily when they do not succeed, show care and respect to each other and play harmoniously with peers during games. Through these group activities settings, students learn to manage themselves as they become more self-aware, as well as develop social awareness and learn to manage relationships with their peers. These values and competencies will help our students live out the Desired Outcomes of Education. 

It is our aim in Serangoon Secondary, that our StaRs will leave the school after four years, equipped with the knowledge and physical skills to play at least seven different types of sports, so that they can continue to pursue healthy living when they enter adulthood by being actively engaged in one or two sports that they enjoy regularly, and limit sedentary time. It is our mission to nurture lifeskills and values through a love for physical activities in each StaR, so as to achieve our vision where every StaR is active and SHINE in sports. Through our PE curriculum and programmes, we embark on a journey of fitness, fun and personal growth together, alongside our StaRs.
