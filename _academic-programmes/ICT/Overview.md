##### Key Programmes
**1. STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in:**

*	Tier 1: Sec 1  3D Modelling and Printing Programme (Semester 2)
<br>The Sec 1 ALP focuses on 3D modelling and printing. In this programme, all Secondary 1 students are immersed in 3D modelling activities to hone their Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills. Through the use of Tinkercad, a 3D modelling software, students design 3D models which can be used to solve problems in the real world context on the theme of “The Future Of Transportation”.
<br>

*   Tier 1: Sec 2 Drones programming (Semester 1)
<br>The Sec 2 ALP focuses on drones programming. In this programme, All Secondary 2 students are immersed in coding activities using Tynker, a programming application, to hone their basic block coding skills. Through the hands-on activities, students apply their learning through the use of programming and critical thinking skills to solve problems in flight simulation, and improve the flight of programmable drones.
<br>
	
* Tier 2 Sec 2 and Sec 3 Infocomm Club Programmes
 <br>Selected Sec 2 and Sec 3 students are provided with opportunities to pursue their interest in programming and apply their knowledge and skills in the Infocomm Club programmes.

##### MOE / ITE Applied Subjects
Selected Sec 3 Express and Sec 3 Normal Technical students will have opportunities to pursue their interest and apply their knowledge and skills in MOE or MOE-ITE applied subjects, such as, Computing and Mobile Robotics.

In Computing, students develop and apply computational thinking skills to formulate computing solutions. The extension of learning in Computing is to allow students to participate in Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs) offered by polytechnics.

In Mobile Robotics, students apply technical knowledge and skills to design and build mobile robots to perform specific tasks. Students can pursue a&nbsp;_Nitec_&nbsp;in Mechatronics &amp; Robotics at ITE Colleges.


##### Achievements
1. Media Computing (MEC) Competition 2019  
- Animation Category (Silver Award)

##### Learning Journeys
Every year, Sec 3 Express computing students attended a programming workshop, organised by Nanyang Polytechnic to hone their skills in Python programming using Micro:bits.  
  
As part of professional development, ALP teachers embarked on a learning journey to ITE College Central and explored opportunities in the the Internet of Things (IoT) using micro-controllers. Teachers attended a workshop on "Introduction to MOE CAT A module IoT Applications", conducted by Mr Lee Boon Liang, senior lecturer in Electronics Engineering, who is also our school's PSG member.
