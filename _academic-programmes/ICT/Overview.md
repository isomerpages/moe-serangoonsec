##### Key Programmes
**1. STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in:**

<li>Tier 1: Sec 1  3D Modelling and Printing Programme (Semester 2)
<br>The Sec 1 ALP focuses on 3D modelling and printing. In this programme, all Secondary 1 students are immersed in 3D modelling activities to hone their Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills. Through the use of Tinkercad, a 3D modelling software, students design 3D models which can be used to solve problems in the real world context on the theme of “The Future Of Transportation”.
<br>

</li><li>Tier 1: Sec 2 Drones programming (Semester 1)
<br>The Sec 2 ALP focuses on drones programming. In this programme, All Secondary 2 students are immersed in coding activities using Tynker, a programming application, to hone their basic block coding skills. Through the hands-on activities, students apply their learning through the use of programming and critical thinking skills to solve problems in flight simulation, and improve the flight of programmable drones.
<br>
	
</li><li>Tier 2 Sec 2 and Sec 3 Infocomm Club Programmes
 <br>Selected Sec 2 and Sec 3 students are provided with opportunities to pursue their interest in programming and apply their knowledge and skills in the Infocomm Club programmes.

##### G1-G3 Computing as Elective Subjects at Upper Secondary

Sec 3 and Sec 4 students will have opportunities to pursue their interest and apply their knowledge and skills in the STEM discipline through Computing. The Computing subject will be offered as an elective subject to G1, G2 and G3 students at the upper secondary level to students who are keen to pursue their interest in Computing, and meet the academic requirements to be offered the subject at Sec 3.

In Computing, students develop and apply computational and inventive thinking skills to formulate computing solutions, and develop students’ dispositions towards striving for accuracy and thoroughness. The extension of learning in Computing will allow students to participate in Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs) offered by polytechnics.
