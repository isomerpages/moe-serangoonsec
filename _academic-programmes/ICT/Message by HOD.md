At Serangoon Secondary School, we are committed to leveraging technology to empower our students and teachers in a digitally evolving world. Our ICT initiatives focus on nurturing future-ready individuals equipped with the skills to thrive in the 21st century.

Aligned with the National Digital Literacy Programme, we integrate personal learning devices into our curriculum, enabling students to embrace technology for self-directed and collaborative learning. This approach not only strengthens their academic foundation but also prepares them for lifelong learning.

Our e-learning system, the Student Learning Space (SLS), extends learning beyond the classroom. Through home-based learning and self-exploration, students are encouraged to discover their passions and deepen their understanding of various subjects.

Digital literacy is a cornerstone of our efforts. We guide students in harnessing technology to effectively “Find, Think, Apply, and Create”, fostering their ability to navigate and contribute to a digital society. Concurrently, we focus on developing critical 21st Century Competencies (21CC), such as Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking, along with Communication, Collaboration, and Information Skills.

This is further complemented by our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), where students cultivate Computational Thinking skills through drone programming and Design Thinking skills through 3D modelling. These activities nurture their passion for STEM disciplines and prepare them to innovate in a technology-driven world.

Teachers at Serangoon Secondary School play a pivotal role in this journey. Through professional development in e-Pedagogy, they are equipped to design impactful, technology-enabled learning experiences tailored to diverse student needs. By integrating tech tools, our teachers enhance engagement and create dynamic classrooms that inspire learning.

Together, these initiatives underscore our dedication to nurturing confident, adaptable learners and educators who are ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.
