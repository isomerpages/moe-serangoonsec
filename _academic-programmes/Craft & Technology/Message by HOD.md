The Craft and Technology department in Serangoon Secondary is passionate about creating an environment that helps our students acquire process skills such as critical and adaptive thinking, problem solving, and communication. The team believes that students equipped with these skills will be ready for the future.

The department uses a project-based approach that exposes students to authentic real-world contexts through a variety of hands-on activities. This approach provides opportunities for students to take on a creative process as they innovate to explore possibilities and alternatives before arriving at an intended outcome. Students will then make use of the appropriate practical skills that they have acquired within the subjects in the creation of their product. While pursuing the creative processes and the creation of products, students exhibit important values including self-directedness and the spirit of excellence while managing the tasks, and attitudes such as perseverance and resilience in order to bring the tasks to completion.

The lower secondary curriculum of Art; Nutrition and Food Science; and Design and Technology equips students with skills such as visual literacy and art-making; nutrition concepts and food literacy; and strategies in visualization, exploration and decision making. These skills provide a foundation for students to take the respective subject at the upper secondary level. Students who do not pursue these subjects at a higher level will also benefit from it as these are also essential foundation skills for a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) education model – a model which provides a well-rounded education.

The upper secondary curriculum creates an environment for students to truly SHINE in their choice subject.  Students dive deep into the projects of the respective subjects with a longer time frame, which is a rigorous test of their values and attitudes. In addition, the curriculum requires students to pursue mastery in their practical skills for the creation of their product. Students also develop a deep sense of ownership and achievement throughout the process, which is an essential ingredient in becoming self-directed learners.

In conclusion, the diversity of the craft and technology subjects along with a common approach to teaching, strives to nurture creativity and develop life skills in our students and empower them in becoming lifelong learners.
