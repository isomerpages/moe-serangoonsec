The department comprises three subjects – Art, Design &amp; Technology, and Nutrition &amp; Food Science. We strive to equip our students with relevant knowledge and foster good values through our subjects, providing them with opportunities to nurture creativity and develop life skills in the process.

A project-based approach is used for all three subjects to make learning authentic and fun for our students. This approach ensures a balance between creative processes and creation of products, providing opportunities for innovation and creative thinking as students explore different possibilities and alternative solutions. Values and life skills like perseverance, time-management and self-evaluation are also nurtured in the process.

**Art Curriculum**

Art curriculum across all levels provides our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It also contributes to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The engagement in art discourse/critique (secondary) in the curriculum promotes a lifelong enjoyment for and an appreciation of artistic works; developing visual literacy in our students. The production of artworks encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.

The lower secondary Visual Art curriculum aims to develop visual literacy skills. At the end of the 2-year art studies, students acquire the basic skills in art-making, they learn to hone their skills and demonstrate their creativity. In the studio, students discuss topics that relate to themes like existence and connections to our world. Students are taught painting, pencil illustration as well as sculpture-making skills, they deal with themes like ‘Comfort creature’, ‘A Surreal Space’ and ‘Our Beautiful World’. Art appreciation is also integrated into lessons to expose students to artists’ works and to develop their visual literacy.

Students at Upper Sec embark on longer term projects. Apart from enhancing the skills they garnered in lower secondary; they are given opportunities to pick up other art forms like digital art, fashion, painting, photography skills and 3D modeling and mixed-media illustration.

**Design &amp; Technology Curriculum**

In D&amp;T, students acquire effective design techniques and strategies and are equipped with a sound working knowledge on plastic, metal, and wood in order to create purposeful and innovative design pieces. The subject encourages students to make close observation of their surroundings to propose solutions or better alternatives. In the designing process, students learn to think creatively and critically, applying various strategies in the visualisation, exploration, and decision-making stages. While the process is rigorous, students often find fulfilment in seeing their ideas come to fruition.

**Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) Curriculum**

The NFS syllabus provide students with a broad understanding of concepts in nutrition and
health, food literacy and principles of food science. Students will be exposed to authentic real-world contexts through hands-on practical and theory concepts. 

NFS students (Sec 3) took part in the yearly in-house programme ‘Connecting Heartily’. Students are encouraged to cook healthy dishes using recipes that they have modified. At the end of the programme, the food made with love were presented to their teachers – an apt way to express gratitude to those who had guided and nurtured them through the years!

In NFS, twenty Secondary 2 students with a keen interest in the subject took part in the annual ‘Talent Development Programme’ conducted at Kitchen Showdown. Blending the concept of “The Power of Play” with culinary challenges to bring people together. The spirit of team building and collectiveness through the array of programmes that are not limited to just cooking but also engaging and memorable activities. Students enjoyed the process of learning and having fun at the same time.

NFS teachers are coaches of understanding, not mere distributors of content knowledge, skill, or activity. They focus on ensuring that learning happens, they always aim and check for successful meaning making and transfer of knowledge by the students. The idea is to teach towards deep understanding rather than a shallow overview of the content.
