### Craft & Technology

##### Our Team

![](/images/01_CraftnTechnology_Dept.jpg)

The department comprises three subjects – Art, Design & Technology, and Nutrition & Food Science. We strive to equip our students with relevant knowledge and foster good values through our subjects, providing them with opportunities to nurture creativity and develop life skills in the process.

A project-based approach is used for all three subjects to make learning authentic and fun for our students. This approach ensures a balance between creative processes and creation of products, providing opportunities for innovation and creative thinking as students explore different possibilities and alternative solutions. Values and life skills like perseverance, time-management and self-evaluation are also nurtured in the process.

In 2018, through the NAC-AMS scheme, the art unit came together to learn printmaking techniques from artist Ernest Chan. The students also had a series of printmaking lessons with the artist, which cumulated to a mini exhibition outside at the school foyer.

#### Our Programmes

###### Art Curriculum

Art is about Perceiving, Communication and Appreciating. Our curriculum strives to expose students to a variety of art materials and techniques while a theme-based approach provides them the opportunity to make meaningful artworks that visually express their creative ideas and personal opinions.

In Lower Sec, students are taught painting, pencil illustration as well as sculpture-making skills, they deal with themes like ‘Fantasy Landscape’, ‘A Surreal Space’ and ‘Our Beautiful World’. Art appreciation is also integrated into lessons to expose students to artists’ works and to develop their visual literacy.

Students at Upper Sec embark on longer term projects. Apart from enhancing the skills they garnered in lower secondary, they are given opportunities to pick up other art forms like digital art, print-making and mixed-media illustration.

###### Design & Technology Curriculum

In D&T, students acquire effective design techniques and strategies and are equipped with a sound working knowledge on plastic, metal, and wood in order to create purposeful and innovative design pieces. The subject encourages students to make close observation of their surroundings to propose solutions or better alternatives. In the designing process, students learn to think creatively and critically, applying various strategies in the visualisation, exploration, and decision-making stages. While the process is rigorous, students often find fulfilment in seeing their ideas come to fruition.

Students taking anthropometric data before commencing with their designs; use of interesting teaching strategies (e.g. building an egg transporter) to teach concepts on structures and reinforcements.

###### Nutrition & Food Science Curriculum

NFS provides students with knowledge and skills, while inculcating in them positive attitudes that will empower them to make informed food and consumer choices. Students are equipped with relevant life skills to independently navigate the wealth of information available to them to make healthier and wiser choices for everyday living.

In 2017, the Nutrition and Food Studies (NFS) teachers conducted a baking session for 10 parent-child pairs, providing precious bonding opportunity over food. The teachers also took the opportunity to share about meal modifications to promote healthy eating amongst parents and students. The success of this event mooted subsequent ideas for the NFS unit. Food has always been a universal language that brings people together. What better way but through food to build and connect a community within the school while promoting a healthy lifestyle?

That same year, as a post-exam activity, twenty Secondary 2 students with a keen interest in the subject Food & Nutrition took part in the annual Craft & Technology talent development programme conducted in-house. Participants conducted interviews to learn about their form teachers’ favourite food. Through research and consultations with the NFS teachers, the students experimented with ways to modify and execute recipes to create healthier versions of those food cited. At the end of the programme, the food made with love were presented to their teachers - an apt way to express gratitude to those who had guided and nurtured them through the years!

In 2018, Connecting HeartilyS3 F&N MasterChef Showcase was launched. The NFS teachers organised a food sampling event where forty Sec 3 F&N students would cook healthy food using recipes they have created, before sharing them with the school during lunchtime. Taking inspiration from food variety shows, staff and students upon sampling the food voted for their favourite Serangoon MasterChef!

Spreading the message of healthy eating through their peers was an memorable experience. Popular recipes were highlighted to canteen vendors, with the prospect of them including some of these food into their stalls’ offerings.
