Globalisation, changing demographics, and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces in the world today, and they will continue to shape our future. At Serangoon Secondary School, the English Language and Literature Department equips students with learning experiences that build the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of the emerging 21st century competencies.

To achieve this, we have in place a 4-year learning roadmap that enhances students’ acquisition of language skills with a spiraling and progressive approach. We have aligned the learning goals for English Language and Literature closely with the Singapore Teaching Practice and the broad aims of the EL syllabus. Specifically, our English and Literature curriculum is designed to nurture confident, articulate, and expressive learners from the lower secondary years. For a stable foundation, students are given authentic and safe platforms to interact, build oracy skills, and express creatively, igniting a lasting appreciation for the language as they progress through our school and beyond. At the upper secondary level, we strengthen students’ ability to communicate coherently and with purpose. They engage with a wider range of texts and contemporary issues, enabling them to form balanced perspectives and respond thoughtfully to the world around them.

To stay aligned with technological shifts, we have developed a comprehensive resource bank, including a teacher-curated microsite, that supports rich and self-directed learning. This has been beneficial in supporting learners of varying readiness in their grammar and writing skills, while also fostering a genuine appreciation for the English language through fun and competitive activities that promote joyful learning.

Collaboration and talent development have also been key approaches to enhance the teaching of both English Language and Literature in Serangoon Secondary School. Together with the Humanities and Science departments, we continually help students see the link between English and other subjects through real-world and authentic contexts that reinforce their learning with strong content knowledge and communication skills.

At the heart of all we do, we focus on students’ learning needs and preferences. The English and Literature department teachers are wholly committed to nurturing students to be confident, competent, and creative learners of English Language and Literature. We collaborate, adapt, and share novel teaching methodologies to meet the diverse learning needs of our students, always looking for opportunities and platforms to build students’ love for language. Guided by students’ learning needs and preferences, we continually refine our practices and share effective teaching approaches that help students to make meaning while expressing ideas clearly. 

With the growing influence of A.I. and how language is increasingly used for impact, our teachers constantly leverage a suite of reliable digital tools to enhance engagement of students. These platforms allow students to explore at their own pace and collaborate with their peers, contributing to deeper and more connected learning experiences. Through these approaches, we create pathways for students to become competent readers, confident communicators, and creative inquirers of English Language and Literature - for life.
