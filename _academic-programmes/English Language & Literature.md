##### 2022 Department Programme Highlights
	
**READING PROGRAMME**

Our reading programme aims to develop good reading habits and instill lifelong passion for reading in our students.

**I.	Read and SHINE daily morning reading programme**

Through our morning reading programme, we cultivate a love of reading in our students, by balancing carefully between assigned reading materials and giving students a choice on what to read. 

This year, we also collaborated with all IP departments on a weekly subject content reading via class Padlets. Students read articles and view related videos to broaden & deepen their perspectives and to integrate learning across the different subjects.

**INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATIONS**

Through inter-departmental collaborations, we aim to extend students’ learning of English beyond the English classroom and provide students with authentic and varied language experiences.   

**I.	Sec 1 Geography-Science-EL Inter-Disciplinary Project Work 2022**

This year, we embarked on a level-wide Science-EL Project Work for our Sec 1 students. Students were guided in oral communication skills – e.g. preparing a script, accurate pronunciation, addressing the audience – for their Project Work class presentation, which formed part of their school-based assessment.

**II.	Humanities-EL Learning Journeys 2022**

As part of post-exam activities this year, we collaborated with the Humanities Department to organise Learning Journeys for Sec 1 and 2 students. Our Sec 1 StaRs had the chance to visit the Kranji War Memorial where they saw for themselves the 4,461 gravestones lined up proudly on a slope to honour the fallen heroes of WWII. Meanwhile, our Sec 2 StaRs enjoyed a scenic treetop walk enroute to the historic coastal fort of Fort Siloso where they learnt more about British defence of Southern Singapore during WWII. 

Armed with their mobile devices, our StaRs vlogged their experience as they explored these sites.
	
**TALENT DEVELOPMENT & ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES

I.	Online Singapore Secondary School Debating Championship 2022**
	
A small group of students with a passion for debating is trained every year for the Singapore Secondary School Debating Championship. This year, we ranked 11th out of 26 schools that took part in Division III of the championship. One of our students also emerged among the Top 20 Speakers in the division. 

Watch our team of debaters in action in 2021 EL Debating Showcase post-exam activity.

**II.	Post-Exam Activity - EL Oratorical Showcase 2022**

As part of our department’s focus on oracy skills, a group of Sec 3 students took part in the 3E and 3NA Oratorical Showcases as part of their post-exam activity this year where three students were crowned Best Orators of each competition.

**III.	Inter-Class Writing Competition**

To promote the love of writing among our students, we organised inter-class writing competitions for the different levels this year. Our budding writers had a go at writing flash fiction and full length essays.
