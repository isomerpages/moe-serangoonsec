#### 2021 Department Programme Highlights

##### READING PROGRAMME

Our reading programme aims to develop good reading habits and instill lifelong passion for reading in our students.

<img src="/images/deptproghighlight1.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">Through our morning reading programme, we cultivate a love of reading in our students, by balancing carefully between assigned reading materials and giving students a choice on what to read.

<br> <br>

###### 2.Partnership with NLB â Read for Books Charity Drive 2021

<img src="/images/deptproghighlight2.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
We partner National Library Board (NLB) so our students can enjoy a wider variety of reading activities under NLBâs Read@School programme.  <br> 
In July this year, our students read not only for pleasure but also for charity as they took part in Read for Books charity book drive. For every 10 of our students who read for 15 minutes, NLB donated one book to selected beneficiaries.

##### INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATIONS

Through inter-departmental collaborations, we aim to extend studentsâ learning of English beyond the English classroom and provide students with authentic and varied language experiences.

###### 1.Science-EL Project Work 2021

<br>
<img src="/images/sci-el-projwork1.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">This year, we embarked on a level-wide Science-EL Project Work for our Sec 1 students. Students were guided in oral communication skills â e.g. preparing a script, accurate pronunciation, addressing the audience â for their Project Work class presentation, which formed part of their school-based assessment

<br> <br>

###### 2.Humanities-EL Virtual Learning Journey 2021

<br>

Students applied their understanding of the semiotic features of a multimodal text taught as part of the 2020 EL Syllabus to create a digital poster that encapsulated key aspects of the virtual learning experience.

##### TALENT DEVELOPMENT & ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES
