At Serangoon Secondary School, the **Mother Tongue Department** plays a vital role in preserving and promoting the richness of our cultural heritage through the teaching and learning of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs).

Learning a Mother Tongue Language is an essential part of our identity. It reflects our history, traditions, and values, connecting us to our roots. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, embracing and promoting our MTLs also fosters a more inclusive and cohesive society, where diverse voices are valued and respected.

Guided by our school’s vision of nurturing **Serangoon StaRs** to become resilience individuals, passionate learners, and active contributors, our team of dedicated MTL teachers strives to create an environment where students are empowered to explore, express, and take pride in their MTLs. 
In the classroom, our curriculum is **student-centric and values-driven**. We adopt the **Task-Based Teaching Approach**, designing authentic and purposeful learning experiences relevant to students’ daily lives. This approach develops their communication skills, critical thinking, and appreciation for culture — which are key elements of the **Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC)**. Through these experiences, our StaRs learn to navigate and contribute meaningfully to a globalised world while remaining grounded in their cultural identity.

Aligned with **EdTech 2030**, we also leverage technology to enhance language learning. By integrating digital platforms, e-resources, and interactive tools, we personalise learning and provide opportunities for students to engage deeply with the language both within and beyond the classroom. Through e-reading portals, news clips, podcasts, documentaries, and animated videos, our StaRs gain insights into current issues, cultural diversity, and global perspectives. Class discussions, debates, show-and-tell sessions, and journal reflections further build their confidence and ability to express themselves fluently and meaningfully in their MTL.

Beyond the classroom, we celebrate the beauty and vibrancy of our MTLs through signature events such as the **Mother Tongue Fortnight, MT Camp,** and learning journeys to local **Heritage Centres, Art Houses, Museums**. The school’s **Overseas Learning Journey** further broaden our students’ cultural horizons, offering authentic contexts for language use and cross-cultural appreciation. We believe that consistent practice in speaking, reading, and writing is the cornerstone of language mastery and lifelong learning.

At the heart of our work is our belief that **every StaR can learn**, and our mission is to help each student learn MTL to the best of their ability. Our **people management philosophy** emphasises collaboration, trust, and professional growth. We believe that a strong, collegial team culture empowers teachers to innovate, support one another, and collectively nurture the holistic development of our students.

To achieve this, we continue to strengthen partnerships with parents, the community, and external organisations to create meaningful opportunities for our StaRs to learn, appreciate, and live out their MTLs. Together, we remain committed to fostering a **student-centric, values-driven education** where language, culture, and character form the foundation of a compassionate and cohesive society.
