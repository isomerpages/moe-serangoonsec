##### SG50 Booklet    

![](/images/sg50.jpg)

To mark SG50, the Humanities Department has published an SG50 Booklet for the school, and as a gift to the nation. The aim of the booklet is to provide readers with an appreciation of Singapore’s history through 50 years of nation building. It provides an account of a significant event that has occurred yearly from 1965-2015. Reading through the booklet, it is our hope that readers will develop a deeper sense of how Singapore has journeyed from tumultuous independence to become what it is today - a modern metropolis with international recognition and high standing in the world.

##### SG50 E-book

As a present from students from all our schools to Singapore for her 50th birthday, a commemorative e-book titled SG50 Reflections: Our **HO**pes &**ME**mories (**HOME**) has been officially launched by our President, Dr Tony Tan on 29 July 2015(Wednesday). The contents of the e-book comprise a diverse range of students’ works about people, places and events that feature six themes over a span of five decades.

Our school is proud to be part of the SG50 e-book project. The team of students that have created this section of the E-book was mentored and guided by the Humanities Department. The details of the E-book are as follows:

Theme : Memorable Spaces

Decade : 1975-1984

#### History

Our History curriculum reflects the vigor of the discipline of History. As an inquiry into the past, History seeks to offer an interpretation of a past event that corresponds as closely as possible to what happened. Through historical inquiry, students then pose questions about the present by engaging with the past and thus draw connections between both.

  

The revised Upper Secondary History syllabus aligns the value of History learning with the aims of the Desired Outcomes of Education by developing in students the qualities of a history learner through engaging students actively in historical inquiry so as to develop them into confident, self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers. Through the process of conducting Historical Investigation in the Lower Secondary syllabus, students have actively been involved in the discipline of History,as well as conducting historical inquiry.

##### Historical Investigation

As part of their History education, students had to go through a Historical Investigation (HI). For their HI, students were tasked to design an End Product that would answer certain investigative questions. Their End Product would be to write a piece of historical fiction based on the sources that they have gathered. In their historical fiction, students are supposed to either write about the lives of teenagers during colonial Singapore or during the Japanese Occupation period.

#### Geography

The Lower Secondary Geography syllabus enables students to acquire the knowledge and skills to understand aspects of physical and human geography. They learn to explain geographical phenomena, environmental and social issues in different places and cultures. Students become aware of the appropriate values and attitudes required to ensure sustainability of our resources, country and the planet Earth. The inquiry based approach teaches the students to ask critical questions and think reflectively on the management of current issues such as water resources and traffic congestion in Singapore.

Upper Secondary Geography emphasises the integration of physical and human environments. It also focuses on the interconnectedness among groups of people, and between people and their environment. The Geography student can expect to acquire the skills of gathering and analysing information, and an enquiring mind to seek answers to issues affecting our lives and the world we live in. Geography students are prepared for their roles as informed citizens in the 21st century. Geographers make informed judgements and sound decisions through the analysis, synthesis and evaluation of geographical information.

##### Geographical Investigation

Students conduct Geographical Investigation at the lower secondary level to investigate geographical issues. They will analyze the investigation question, plan their research, gather and select data, analyze data and finally arrive at their own conclusions regarding the issue. Through this process, they will learn to evaluate and communicate their findings through the use of an info-graph. In Secondary 1, they will look at the concept of "water quality" before moving on to exploring the concept of "inclusive housing". These two concepts expose students to a wide variety of investigative methods and bring the real world into the classroom for them.

#### Humanities Engagement Programme

##### Humanities Engagement Week 2020

This year’s Humanities Engagement Week had to be shifted online given the circumstances of COVID-19. The Humanities Department collaborated with Music to extend our lower secondary students’ understanding of Humanities beyond the textbook and show how it is very much present even in a seemingly unrelated discipline. With the upper secondary students, the activity showed how information and skills learnt in History, Geography and Social Studies can be weaved together, showing that Humanities subjects are not mutually exclusive of one another.

We used the Escape Room and Quiz strategies to get our students' participation in the activities. With these strategies, students would have to be self-directed and resourceful to find information that are relevant to the activities.

Through these activities, our students were exposed, had experienced and were educated on various aspects of Humanities. The engagement week allowed our students to experience humanities not as separate subjects but one discipline. This further educated our students that humanities can be all encompassing and is present in various aspects of the Singaporean society.

#### Humanities Awareness Week 2019

##### Humanities Awareness Week 2019

The Humanities Awareness Week- ‘In Search of Us’ was conducted in school to raise students’ awareness on how Humanities is relevant in our daily lives.<br>
A programme that targeted mainly Sec 1 to 3 students, it was one of the ways to get our students to get ‘Exposure’, enable ‘Exploration’ and to acquire ‘Education’ on Humanities subjects. 

One of the highlights was organising our very own Humanities Amazing Race for our lower secondary students.
