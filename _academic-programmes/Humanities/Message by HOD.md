The Humanities Department in Serangoon Secondary is dedicated to fostering an environment that promotes learning, growth, and the development of essential skills, knowledge, and values in the field of Humanities.

Humanities is a subject that encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including History, Geography and Social Studies. It teaches students about the world around them, encouraging them to explore diverse cultures, perspectives, and ideas.

At our school, we use an Inquiry-Based Learning approach to designing our curriculum. This means that we encourage students to ask questions, investigate, and discover answers on their own. We believe that this approach helps students to develop Critical thinking and Problem-solving skills that they can apply to any subject.

In addition to classroom learning, we also believe in nourishing our students’ curiosity about the real world through authentic learning experiences, such as Learning Journeys and Historical and Geographical Investigations.  These experiences allow our students to immerse themselves in the subject matter and hone their understanding of Humanities in a broader context.

To help our students develop a deeper knowledge and appreciation of the Humanities discipline, we offer various learning opportunities such as competitions, seminars and research projects. These platforms foster our students’ intellectual growth and connectedness to learning through stretching their cognitive skills and challenging them to reach their fullest potential.

Above all, we believe that learning Humanities is important for all students. It helps them to understand and appreciate the world around them and interrogate and advocate for social issues. Through cultivating an open-mindedness towards multiple perspectives and ideas, the Humanities learning experience uncovers our students’ innate sense of empathy and interest in public issues.

We envisage that our school’s Humanities programme will inspire and develop our students to harness their critical and critical thinking to navigate complex global issues.

We look forward to working with our students to instill the Joy of Learning in Humanities!
