### Mathematics


#### Our Vision
Every student is passionate about Mathematics
<hr>

#### Our Mission
*   To provide a level of mastery in Mathematics for all students that will serve them well in life  
    
*   To enable students with interest and ability to pursue Mathematics at the highest possible level
<hr>

#### Our Curriculum

**Key Objectives**

* Provide opportunities for students to learn and apply concepts and skills to solve problems, including those in real-world contexts;

* Develop process and meta-cognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;

* Inculcate positive attitudes towards Mathematics (confidence, interest, appreciation, perseverance, beliefs);

* Strengthen the development of students’ digital literacy and technological skills through Mathematics

* Develop students’ 21st century competencies to think critically, adaptively and inventively, reason logically and communicate effectively using mathematics, work individually as well as in groups, using EdTech tools where appropriate in learning and doing mathematics. 


#### Overview of our Mathematics Learning Framework

**Learning Experiences for students**

The department places a strong emphasis on students’ motivation to learn Mathematics. We believe students have diverse learning needs and seek to provide learning experiences for them through three phases of their learning – Readiness, Engagement and Mastery:

* Establishing a Positive Mathematics Classroom Culture

* Leveraging EdTech to customise students’ learning and develop their digital literacy and technological skills

* Developing Computational Thinking skills in the students through tasks involving algorithm design

* Providing opportunities for students to work independently and collaboratively on tasks relating Mathematics to the real-world context 

* Facilitating activity-based and inquiry-based learning in Mathematics

<hr>

#### Our Support for Students Learning Mathematics

* Mastery Learning Programme

* Lower Sec Foundation Mathematics Bridging Programme

* Bridging Programmes for students taking more demanding level subjects

* Secondary 1 Math Learning Day

* Financial Literacy Programmes

* Mathematical Competitions

#### Our Programme Highlights

To deepen students’ motivation to learn Mathematics, students are given opportunities to learn Mathematics through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS) AI tools, SLS gamification features and working on problems in real world contexts.

Students learning digital literacy and technological skills such as the use of Spreadsheets and Mathematical graphing software.

Students engaging in self-directed learning through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS) AI tools such as SLS FA-Math and SLS Adaptive Learning System to engage in self-assessment and to develop their metacognition in Mathematics.

Students applying their communication and reasoning skills by working collaboratively on mathematical exploratory tasks.

Students applying their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking skills to solve Mathematical problems in real-world context. 

Learning Mathematics in fun and meaningful ways: Students applying their learning of Mathematical concepts through playing Mathematics game cards designed by their Mathematics teachers.

Financial Literacy: Students learning about their financial needs at various life stages to develop their financial capabilities to plan for their future.

#### Principles of Accounts (POA)

**Introduction**

Principles of Accounts introduces students to the world of business. Students will learn the basics of financial accounting and develop their abilities to prepare and analyse accounting information to provide insights about the performance and position of a business as well as to communicate and use the information for decision-making.

In the learning process, students will also realise the importance of professional ethics in the business environment. These thinking skills, values and approaches to problem solving are enduring and valuable for any field of work that the students may endeavour to undertake in an increasingly complex world.

**Our Support for Students Learning POA**

Students will learn POA through a variety of experiences such as:

* Mastery Learning Programme
* Hands-on activities
* Reading of articles
* Working collaboratively
* Learning through videos
* Competitions
