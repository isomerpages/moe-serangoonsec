### Mathematics


#### Our Vision
Every student is passionate about Mathematics
<hr>

#### Our Mission
*   To provide a level of mastery in Mathematics for all students that will serve them well in life  
    
*   To enable students with interest and ability to pursue Mathematics at the highest possible level
<hr>

#### Our Curriculum

**Key Objectives**

* Provide opportunities for students to learn and apply concepts and skills to solve problems, including those in real-world contexts;

* Develop process and meta-cognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;

* Inculcate positive attitudes towards Mathematics (confidence, interest, appreciation, perseverance, beliefs);

* Strengthen the development of students’ digital literacy and technological skills through Mathematics

* Develop students’ 21st century competencies to think critically, adaptively and inventively, reason logically and communicate effectively using mathematics, work individually as well as in groups, using EdTech tools where appropriate in learning and doing mathematics. 


#### Overview of our Mathematics Learning Framework

**Learning Experiences for students**

The department places a strong emphasis on students’ motivation to learn Mathematics. We believe students have diverse learning needs and seek to provide learning experiences for them through three phases of their learning – Readiness, Engagement and Mastery:

* Establishing a Positive Mathematics Classroom Culture

* Leveraging EdTech to customise students’ learning and develop their digital literacy and technological skills

* Developing Computational Thinking skills in the students through tasks involving algorithm design

* Providing opportunities for students to work independently and collaboratively on tasks relating Mathematics to the real-world context 

* Facilitating activity-based and inquiry-based learning in Mathematics

<hr>

#### Our Support for Students Learning Mathematics

* Mastery Learning Programme
* Foundation Mathematics Bridging Programme
* SBB/OOS Bridging Programme
* Secondary 1 Math Learning Day
<hr>

#### Our Programme Highlights

To develop positive attitudes (beliefs, interests, appreciation, confidence, perseverance) and joy of learning Mathematics in students, students are given opportunities to learn Mathematics through playing of games and working on collaborative tasks.

#### Principles of Accounts (POA)
##### Introduction
Principles of Accounts introduces students to the world of business. Students will learn the basics of financial accounting and develop their abilities to prepare and analyse accounting information to provide insights about the performance and position of a business as well as to communicate and use the information for decision-making. 

In the learning process, students will also realise the importance of professional ethics in the business environment. These thinking skills, values and approaches to problem solving are enduring and valuable for any field of work that the students may endeavour to undertake in an increasingly complex world.

##### Our Support for Students Learning POA

Students will learn POA through a variety of experiences such as:
* Mastery Learning Programme
* Hands-on activities
* Reading of articles
* Working collaboratively
* Learning through videos
