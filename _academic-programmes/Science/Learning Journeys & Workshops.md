##### Secondary 2 Science Learning Journey – Visit to Kok Fah Farm 
##### 
As part of the Learning Week activities in Term 4, our Secondary 2 students visited Kok Fah farm, which practises high-tech agriculture.

Through the visit, it was envisioned that students could learn more about efforts to produce food locally, as well as pertinent issues such as food security. In addition, the visit also complemented the visits to our school’s Science Garden, which are part of the Secondary 2 Science curriculum. More importantly, the visit also aims to inspire joyful learning amongst students.

As part of the visit, the students were brought on a tour to a greenhouse where research and development into various crops was carried out. The students also tried their hands at planting their own pots of microgreens.
