### Secondary 2 Science Learning Journey – Visit to Kok Fah Farm


![](/images/Visit%20to%20Kok%20Fah%20Farm%202022/01.png)


As part of the Learning Week activities in Term 4, our Secondary 2 students visited Kok Fah farm, which practises high-tech agriculture.

Through the visit, it was envisioned that students could learn more about efforts to produce food locally, as well as pertinent issues such as food security. In addition, the visit also complemented the visits to our school’s Science Garden, which are part of the Secondary 2 Science curriculum. More importantly, the visit also aims to inspire joyful learning amongst students.

As part of the visit, the students were brought on a tour to a greenhouse where research and development into various crops was carried out. The students also tried their hands at planting their own pots of microgreens.

### Secondary 1 Learning Week Activities – Squid Dissection Workshop

As part of the Learning Week activities in Term 4, our Secondary 1 students took part in a Squid Dissection Workshop organized by Young Nautilus.

The workshop aims to allow students to apply scientific content learnt during their lessons to real-life applications, and to learn and appreciate the important of environmental conservation and sustainability. More importantly, the workshop aims to inspire the joy of learning in students.

In the workshop, students first learnt about molluscs, their anatomical features, and the important role that they play in the ecosystem. Next, they got the chance to try dissecting squids, while learning more about the various parts of the squid in the process.
