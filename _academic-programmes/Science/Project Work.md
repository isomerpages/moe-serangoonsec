It aims to integrate the application of inter-subject disciplinary knowledge and skills for Science, English Language and Geography in an authentic setting to make learning more purposeful, relevant and joyful.


In this Project Work, the Secondary 1 students applied their knowledge of Separation Techniques, learnt in Science, to construct a water filtration system. They then applied their knowledge of water quality parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of their filtration systems. Their findings were then communicated through an oral presentation.
