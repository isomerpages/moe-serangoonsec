![](/images/Sec%201%20Science%20Project%20Work/IPW_main.jpg)

The Secondary 1 Interdisciplinary Project Work is an alternative assessment task which was designed and implemented as collaborative effort between the Humanities, Science and English Language departments

It aims to integrate the application of inter-subject disciplinary knowledge and skills for Science, English Language and Geography in an authentic setting to make learning more purposeful, relevant and joyful.

In this Project Work, the Secondary 1 students applied their knowledge of Separation Techniques, learnt in Science, to construct a water filtration system. They then applied their knowledge of water quality parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of their filtration systems. Their findings were then communicated through an oral presentation.

Through this project work, students learnt important skills such as teamwork, data analysis and communication skills which will serve them well in the future.
