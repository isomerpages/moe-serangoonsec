In this Project Work, the Secondary 1 students applied their knowledge of Separation Techniques, learnt in Science, to construct a water filtration system. They then applied their knowledge of water quality parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of their filtration systems. Their findings were then communicated through an oral presentation.
