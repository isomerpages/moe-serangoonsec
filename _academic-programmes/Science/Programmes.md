### Programmes

#### 2020
##### 1.Sec 1 and 2 - ‘Science Comes Alive
This year, the Science Department embarked on a new format for the lower secondary students to participate in a virtual science escape game. The objective of this game is to allow students to make connections to the lower secondary science topics and apply the concepts to solve a series of problems at 4 different stages of the game. At the final stage of the game, students will put together the words collected from each stage to form a sentence, in order to ‘escape’ successfully.

###### The winners (top classes) are as follow:
Highest Average Class Points:
*   1SD1 (2.78) 
*   1SD4 (2.91)
*   1SD8 (5.05)
*   2H1B (2.94)
*   2H2 (3.54)
*   2H8 (4.17)

##### 2.Sec 3 Workshops 2020
Various workshops were organised for Secondary 3 students during the post-exam programme. The main objective of these workshops is to help students understand the real world applications of science and to enhance the joy of learning science.

###### a) Secondary 3 Science Physics Workshop - NUS Demo Lab
The Secondary 3 Express Science Physics students explored a series of Physics demonstrations brought in by the NUS Physics Demo Lab facilitators. During the workshop, the facilitators explained the principles behind each experiment. The manipulatives used at the workshop also covered topics across different themes of the O- Level Physics syllabus. This supplemented students’ understanding of how the concepts learnt in school are used in other applications. In addition, students also made their own Physics toys with materials provided by the Demo Lab.

###### b) Secondary 3 Science Biology Workshop - Genetic Diseases  
In this workshop by Science Centre, the Sec 3 Express Science Biology students were exposed to micropipetting techniques as well as a DNA analysis technique known as agarose gel electrophoresis. They also got to learn more about how genetic diseases come about and genetic testing and implications.

###### c) Secondary 3 Optical Spectroscopy Workshop
In this workshop by Science Centre, the Secondary 3 Pure Science students got to build their own spectroscopes (which they can keep and use for further investigations). They also got to use them to observe spectra of various light sources, culminating in the observation of Fraunhofer spectral lines in daylight.

###### d) Secondary 3 Normal Academic Chemistry Perfumery Workshop  
A perfumery workshop was conducted for all the Secondary 3 Normal Academic (NA) students. During the workshop, students got to understand the chemistry concepts behind the making of perfume. They also had the opportunity to use various chemicals to make their own perfume!

###### e) Secondary 3NT Virtual Intertidal Exploration Workshop
In this workshop, our Secondary 3 Normal Technical (NT) students were engaged in a intertidal exploration experience, where they got to learn about habitats in Singapore virtually. They also had the opportunity to touch and feel artefacts brought in for the workshop.
