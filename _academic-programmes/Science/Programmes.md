##### Science Garden Enrichment Programme 2022

**Context **

The Science Garden Enrichment Programme aims to bring about the joy of learning in Science beyond the curriculum through the use of the Science Garden to demonstrate application of Science.

The programme is made up of two sessions that provides experiential learning for the Secondary 2 students through different hands-on activities and a guided tour. The Science Garden has two curated sections, hydroponics which is housed in the greenhouse and the garden. Students are introduced to how a hydroponic system works and get to transplant seedlings to the system. In the garden, students are introduced to different types of plants and herbs. 

Reflective questions in suitable IT platforms such as Padlet are used to guide the students to reflect and internalize the knowledge. Students would also go through a lesson package in Student Learning Space (SLS) to create awareness on our countryâ€™s dependency on external food sources and thus the issue on food security which then leads to the government's effort to move into high technology farming in Singapore. 

**Purpose**

From the programme, students will be able to:

* experience the joy of learning in an outdoor environment beyond the classroom.

* experience hydroponic framing, which is an example of high tech farming in Singapore.

* compare high-tech farming and traditional farming with the variety of plants found in the different sections of the Science Garden.

* identify the different plants in the Science Garden and appreciate how they can be grown for food in our daily lives.

* be aware of the national issues such as the value of national food sources and food security in Singapore.
