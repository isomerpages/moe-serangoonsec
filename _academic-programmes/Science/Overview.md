### <center>Science Department Curriculum Goals</center>


The curriculum goals of the department are referenced from the Science Curriculum Framework, where we aim to: 

* enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, which can help them to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives. 

* provide strong science foundations for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

### <center>Science Department Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) Framework</center>

The department’s T&amp;L framework is guided by the school vision and school philosophy at its core. It takes reference from the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) and encapsulates the various pedagogical and assessment practices that aim to realise the vision of science education i.e. for every Serangoon StaR to:

* be INspired by Science, 

* INquire like Scientists, and 

* INnovate using Science.

### <center>Talent Development Model</center>



The Elemental Forge, the Science Talent Framework, is an extension of the Science Department’s Teaching and Learning Framework, to stretch our students through a structured, tiered approach in our enrichment programme.  It has two wings – The Practical and Experiential wing as well as the Creative and Innovative wing. 
The Practical and Experiential wing aims to develop cognitive rigour and practical scientific skillsets and exposure to authentic laboratory and field-based experiences. This wing directly supports the teaching and learning emphasis on scientific inquiry. Through real-world and experiential activities, students become inspired by the relevance of science, strengthening both motivation and conceptual understanding.

The Creative and Innovative wing focuses on innovation, design, prototyping and creative problem-solving through science. It reinforces the department’s belief that science is not a body of knowledge but also a tool for improving lives and contributing to society.

The Elemental Forge uses cross-cutting themes such as forces of nature, resilient society, Human Health and Well-being as well as Sustainable Living Systems.

The diagram shows the tired approach in our enrichment programme. The activities in each tier are some examples of our students’ experience.
