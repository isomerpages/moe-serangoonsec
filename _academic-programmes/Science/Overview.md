### <center>Science Department Curriculum Goals</center>


The curriculum goals of the department are referenced from the Science Curriculum Framework, where we aim to: 

* enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, which can help them to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives. 

* provide strong science foundations for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

### <center>Science Department Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) Framework</center>

The department’s T&amp;L framework is guided by the school vision and school philosophy at its core. It takes reference from the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) and encapsulates the various pedagogical and assessment practices that aim to realise the vision of science education i.e. for every Serangoon StaR to:

* be INspired by Science, 

* INquire like Scientists, and 

* INnovate using Science.

### <center>Talent Development Model</center>

Through various tiers of programmes catered to the needs of different segments of students, students can learn by doing and have opportunities to demonstrate and deepen their ways of thinking and doing science and critical thinking skills. These experiences beyond the classroom would also enable them to connect theoretical concepts to real-life applications.
