##### Scientists-in-School (SiS) Programme 2022

Scientists-in-School (SiS) Programme is a programme jointly organised by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE). The programme aims to engage students in STEM research and activities, thereby extending their knowledge beyond the school curriculum and deepening the joyful learning of science. 

A group of enthusiastic Secondary 3 students with a keen interest in science have embarked on their journey as young scientists under the guidance of Dr Liu Huajun, a Materials Science scientist from A*STAR.

To further enrich students’ learning experience, students went on a learning journey to ASTAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering on 25 August 2022. They visited the cleanrooms where the silicon wafers are fabricated and are introduced to various machines used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. They even experienced the wearing of cleanroom-approved apparel over their school uniforms and witnessed the scientists at work. 

Here is a quote from Heng Song Wei of 3I8: “I got to learn many new things that we won't learn in normal school curriculum.” This shows how the programme has inspired a joy of learning in students beyond the classroom through Dr Liu’s engaging laboratory sessions and extensive knowledge in the applications of Materials Science. 

The most valuable lesson for our Serangoon StaRs is aptly summed by Ausdin Toh of 3I8, “**"We must continuously keep learning and never give up."**”

##### IgnITE Challenge 2022

Ending the term on a celebratory note, the Science department is pleased to announce the result of the IgnITE Challenge 2022, that is organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).  The IgnITE Skills Challenge is an annual competition that introduces students to technical skills and fosters a deeper understanding of courses offered by ITE. Out of the 7 teams from our school, two teams from 3I3 and 3I4  qualified for the Finals round of the Artificial Intelligence(AI) Car and Mad Mocktail Challenges respectively. We are proud to share that the team from 3I3 had been awarded the Silver medal for designing and programming the fastest and most accurate car in the AI Car Challenge. 
We would like to affirm the efforts of all 21 students who participated in the IgnITE Skills Challenges 2022 and displayed the values of resilience and excellence. We also would like to thank the group of teacher-mentors for guiding the students over the past two months, and making learning beyond the classroom so enjoyable and memorable!
