### Competitions

##### 1.Shell NXplorers 2020  

NXplorers is an innovative educational programme that introduces young people to the complex and creative thinking needed to bring about positive change.

The programme aims to build awareness, develop knowledge and provide thinking tools and complex problem solving skills to the leaders of the future.

In this programme, a group of 5 Secondary 3 students explored issues relating to food, water and energy, and proposed various plans for positive action for change. This has helped them to develop skills such as systems thinking and complex problem solving.

##### 2. Elementz Science Research Competition 2019
A group of 4 students from the Secondary 2 level represented the school in this year’s Elementz Competition. The objectives of this competition are to generate interest in scientific study through investigative-type projects in science, and provide a platform for schools in the North Zone to exhibit and share their findings. The students also had to create a poster to showcase their findings of the project, stating its purpose, method, main findings and conclusion(s).

This year, our students compared the use of various packaging materials which are commonly used in the market, such as paper, styrofoam and plastic. Eggs were used to represent a fragile item, which were then wrapped and dropped from a fixed height. Breakages for each material were recorded before reaching a conclusion.
