##### Physics
The O-Level Physics syllabus provides students with a coherent understanding of energy, matter, and their interrelationships. It focuses on investigating natural phenomena and then applying patterns, models (including mathematical ones), principles, theories and laws to explain the physical behaviour of the universe. The theories and concepts presented in this syllabus belong to a branch of physics commonly referred to as classical physics. Modern physics, developed to explain the quantum properties at the atomic and sub-atomic level, is built on knowledge of these classical theories and concepts.

##### Chemistry
The O-Level Chemistry syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adapted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long term value in an increasingly technological world rather than focusing on large quantities of factual materials, which may have only short term relevance. The syllabus emphasises on:

(i) the finite life of the worldâ€™s resources and hence the need for recycling and conservation,

(ii) economic considerations in the chemical industry, such as the availability and cost of raw materials and energy,

(iii) the social, environmental, health and safety issues relating to the chemical industry and

(iv) the importance of chemicals in industry and in everyday life

##### Biology
The O-Level Biology syllabus is designed to have less emphasis on factual material, but a much greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long-term value in an increasingly complex and globalised world, rather than focusing on large quantities of factual material, which may have only short-term relevance.
