### Biology

**Rescuing Eating Accidents!**

Just like many Singaporeans, many of us love to eat and some accidents will inevitably happen during our eating sprees! In relation to what they have learnt on biological molecules and as part of their Alternative Assessment, our Secondary 3 Biology students investigated on the effectiveness of 5 commonly used detergents in removing chilli oil, chocolate, turmeric, soy sauce and milk coffee stains on clothes.

This is their maiden attempt at planning, designing and implementing a scientific investigation from scratch, culminating in the creation of a poster and a presentation in class. Our students found the experience authentic and would recommend the continuation of such an activity for their juniors! So which detergent is most effective in removing each type of food stain? Look for some of the answers in the posters below!

### Chemistry

In relation to what they have learnt on separation techniques and as part of their Alternative Assessment, our Secondary 3 Chemistry students experienced how forensic science is used to solve crimes. 

The lessons and assessment was designed based on e-pedagogy. In groups, students planned their own scientific investigation, and learnt about various methods and skills needed to analyse physical evidence from crime scenes. They used technological tools to do research, understand the process of the task as well as to showcase their products. The design of the assessment was to enhance collaborative and self -directed learning. 

By using authentic learning in the Alternative Assessment, the learning experience of students was enhanced as they were intrinsically motivated to learn and apply what they have learnt.

### Physics

The Sec 3 Physics students were tasked to work together in groups to design and build a simple Rube Goldberg machine for their performance task. They also engaged in scientific research to align the design of their machine to scientific concepts from the Newtonian mechanics topics.

This task has helped to provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively with others and enhance their content mastery and problem-solving skills.
