##### Chemistry

In relation to what they have learnt on separation techniques and as part of their Alternative Assessment, our Secondary 3 Chemistry students experienced how forensic science is used to solve crimes. 

The lessons and assessment was designed based on e-pedagogy. In groups, students planned their own scientific investigation, and learnt about various methods and skills needed to analyse physical evidence from crime scenes. They used technological tools to do research, understand the process of the task as well as to showcase their products. The design of the assessment was to enhance collaborative and self -directed learning. 

By using authentic learning in the Alternative Assessment, the learning experience of students was enhanced as they were intrinsically motivated to learn and apply what they have learnt.
