Science has played a part in enabling the development of important technological innovations and unlocking new frontiers. From developing newer and faster smartphones, to finding a cure for new pathogens such as COVID-19,  it is evident that Science has been and is a critical aspect in advancing towards a better quality of life.

As we navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world, the half-life of technology will become shorter and scientific knowledge may become obsolete much faster than before. Therefore, as Science educators, we play an important role in igniting and sustaining students’ passion in learning science and in equipping them with skillsets and mindsets necessary for them to embrace ambiguity in the future. Other than inspiring joyful learning, it is crucial for educators to support students in embracing values in scientific inquiry and discovery, ethics in science and resilience in the pursuit of scientific knowledge and technological advancements. This is also aligned to our schools’ vision ‘Resilient Individuals, Passionate Learners, Active Contributors’.

First, our department strives to develop Serangoon StaRs holistically and cultivate their interest and confidence in learning Science. Our talent development model consists of tiers of student-centric programmes which are thoughtfully designed and customised to students of different profiles and needs. These programmes serve to complement and/or extend the learning of science by exposing students to authentic real-world applications and nurturing inquiring minds through hands-on experiences. They also enable students to appreciate the relevance of what they learn in the classroom in a relatable way.

Second, our teachers are constantly adapting and adopting a wide range of pedagogical and assessment practices that cater to our diverse student needs. One of our focus is on scientific inquiry, or practices of science, which aims to promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, deepen sense-making of scientific information and ethical decision-making, as well as enhance the ability and confidence to communicate scientific ideas effectively. With the introduction of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) in schools, our teachers leverage the affordances of technology to enrich the learning of science using interactive platforms and multimodal representations. We provide opportunities for students to connect meaningfully through experiential learning and engage in collaborative learning to co-create knowledge together with their teachers and peers.

Third, to help our students become creators of new solutions for tomorrow’s challenges, our teachers also need to be exposed to diverse and rich experiences beyond the school and keep themselves up-to-date with the latest scientific knowledge, technological advancements, as well as careers and industries of tomorrow. The department is dedicated in learning, unlearning and re-learning. These fresh perspectives and insights that our teachers gain through rigorous reflective cycles and various learning platforms would increase our capacities and capabilities to further broaden the experiences that we could provide for our students.

With a committed team of Science teachers who exemplify lifelong learning for our Serangoon StaRs, I am confident that we can pave the way to realise the vision of science education in Singapore, where every student can be inspired by Science, inquire like scientists, and innovate using Science.
