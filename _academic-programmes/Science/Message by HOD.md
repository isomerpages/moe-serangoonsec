Science education is a powerful tool that opens doors to understanding the world around us. It empowers one to think critically, solve problems, and engage with the ever-evolving challenges of our world. By fostering curiosity and a love for discovery, science education nurtures creativity and innovation. Whether it is technological disruptions (e.g. artificial intelligence), or solving global issues like climate change, science is the foundation of progress in improving lives and addressing global challenges. 

In this increasing complex world, we must prepare our students to be ready for the future. Through the infusion of STEM in our Science education, we want our students to be curious about the world around them, to think creatively and critically in solving problems, and be concerned citizens who make a difference in society. This aligns closely with our school’s vision of developing ‘Resilient Individuals, Passionate Learners, Active Contributors’. Beyond mastery of knowledge, we will equip our students with skills and competencies that will enable them to navigate their future and thrive.

Our department is dedicated to the holistic development of our Serangoon StaRs to be Passionate, Proficient and Future-Ready Individuals. Through our tiered talent development model, our team of passionate Science teachers design learning experiences tailored to meet the diverse needs of our students. These learning experiences provide authentic, hands-on experiences that connect classroom learning to real-world applications, allowing students to appreciate the relevance of Science in their daily lives.

To meet the diverse needs of our students, our teachers leverage a wide range of pedagogical and assessment approaches. One of our key areas of focus is scientific inquiry, which promotes critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and effective communication of scientific ideas. With the advent of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) in schools, our educators are harnessing the potential of technology to design interactive and engaging learning experiences. This fosters meaningful connections through collaborative and experiential learning opportunities that allow students to co-create knowledge with their peers and teachers.

Equipping our students to address future challenges also requires us, as educators, to continually learn and grow. By engaging in professional development, staying updated on the latest advancements in science and technology, and exploring emerging careers and industries, our teachers gain fresh insights that enrich the learning experiences we offer. Through reflection and innovation, the department remains committed to broadening the horizons of both our students and ourselves.

With the unwavering dedication of our Science educators, who exemplify lifelong learning and a passion for teaching, I am confident that we can inspire every student to see the wonder in Science, think critically like scientists, and apply their knowledge to innovate for the future. I look forward to journey with each and everyone in our One StaR Family to nurture every Serangoon StaRs to SHINE and realise his/her potential.
