### SG50 NDP Marching Contingent

Four of our Sec 2 cadets were involved in SG50 National Day Parade this year. 
They were part of the marching contingent representing SSS Red Cross during NDP. They went for training on every Saturday since March and clocked about 148 hrs in foot drill rehearsals. This is what they have to say.

"Even though the trainings were extremely tough and tiring, the sweat and tears were all worth it because we got closer to our trainers and made new friends while representing Singapore Red Cross."

a really unforgettable experience for me. Trainings were tough as we had to stand under the hot sun for at least an hour and we had to sacrifice our Saturdays for about 12 hours each time over the course of 5 months to make our foot drills better. I felt that trainings were worth it as I made new friends and of course get to march in this year's NDP as it is SG50."

"We have learnt to perform the different drills and commands given. We have managed to make new friends throughout the NDP journey. It was a memorable experience that we can never forget."
