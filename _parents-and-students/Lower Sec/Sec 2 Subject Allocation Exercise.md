### Sec 2 Subject Allocation Exercise

Dear Parents/Guardians,

Thank you for joining us for our Sec 2 Parent Talk on ‘Upper Secondary Subject Combinations &amp; Eligibility Criteria’ on 15 March 2025.

We have compiled all the useful information such as the information relating to different subjects and Post-Secondary Pathways onto the microsite at [https://go.gov.sg/sae2025 ](https://go.gov.sg/sae2025 )

The slides used on 15 March as well as the list of FAQs will also be posted on the microsite by early Term 2. This microsite will be updated along the year with relevant information to help you and your child/ward make an informed decision at the end of the year.
