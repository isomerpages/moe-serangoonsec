#### Father-Child Experiential Workshop

Recognising the importance of nurturing the bonds between fathers and their adolescent children, our school hosted a 3-hour workshop by the Centre of Fathering Singapore. Held on 26 August, this workshop brought together nine pairs of fathers and children. 

A fun-filled and interactive affair, the Father-Child Experiential Workshop aimed to provide an engaging space for fathers and their children to bond. Through practical, hands-on activities, participating fathers were guided by skilled facilitators on strategies to help them relate better to their children.

Here are some heartfelt comments from fathers who attended the event:

Mr. Ferozi, father of Mohamed Fatris, 3I6: "It's a very engaging, interesting, educational, and inspirational event."

Mr. Kelvin Teo, father of Nerissa Teo, 1SD6: "Every father should attend this programme at least once in order to know if they need it or not."

Mr. Edward Lim, father of Cowan Lim, 2H7: "Give it a try to make a positive change to the relationship."

Mr. Bennett Tan, father of Abigail Tan, 1SD8: "It's fun and helps my kid to understand that her father cares."

We are glad that the workshop has offered our StaRs and their fathers a unique opportunity to strengthen their connections!
