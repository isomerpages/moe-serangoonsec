"Citius, Altius, Fortius" - which means, “Faster, Higher, Stronger” - was this year’s Sec 3 Outdoor Adventure Camp theme. The camp aims to instill in our StaRs resilience & self-confidence when facing challenges, express empathy positively to each other & build teamwork through outdoor activities.

Highlights of the camp included, Best Group & Best Flag competitions, Team-building Activities, Low Elements Challenge, Outdoor Cooking, Raft Building, Amazing Race, Kayaking, Hiking & Mini-Campfire. Although this year’s camp was non-residential and the campfire was a miniature version conducted at class level (instead of a bonfire at cohort level), the camaraderie was obvious & the enthusiasm was red hot!

All said & done, the true litmus test is when our StaRs exhibit most, if not all, objectives of the camp in the days & months ahead. Till the next StaRs Level Programme in 2022…

“For the Growth of Self & the Good of Others.”
