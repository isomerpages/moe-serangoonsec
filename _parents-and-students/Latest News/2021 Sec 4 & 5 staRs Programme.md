The Sec 4 and 5 StaRs Programme is an iconic cohort-level student development experience to hone our students’ social and emotional competencies, enabling them to grow holistically and learn for life. In this four day non-residential programme, students gained greater awareness of the post-secondary options available to them. They were also equipped with a positive mindset and the necessary skills in their pursuit of academic excellence in their graduating year.

On the first day, students attended talks hosted by various Institutes of Higher Learning, sharing with them the various pathways and how post-secondary education life would be like. The students also benefited from Learning from the StaRs, when their seniors shared with them study tips and their own education journeys. Sessions by our Education and Career Guidance Counsellor helped our students discover their strengths and interests.

On the second and third days, students attended a workshop to get them to be future-ready. Through a series of activities, students gained greater clarity in their understanding of the relation between their dreams and their current studies. As the bigger picture of their future is painted in clearer terms to them, students took a greater interest in equipping themselves with study skills, tools which will make their learning more organised and effective. Students went on to examine their values and purpose, allowing them to enunciate clearly what drives them and why they want to pursue a particular course. Students also learnt the importance of planning for the future. Students were also given the practical tools and experience they needed to ace an interview. As part of the workshop, all students went through a mock interview for them to practice the skills that they had acquired.

Ending the programme on a high, our students got to experience target archery. Through archery, students learnt the importance of composure and focusing on the process and fundamentals. Lastly, through team building games, students understood that everyone has a value to contribute to the team and desire to create and be part of a great team.
