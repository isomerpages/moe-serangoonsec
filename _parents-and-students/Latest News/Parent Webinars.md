### Parent Webinars

Dear Parent/Guardian,  

We will be having 2 Zoom Webinars on 29 May 2021 (Saturday). <br>We strongly encourage you to attend these sessions, so as to better prepare your child/ward.

9.00am to 10.00am- Sec 1 to 3 Parent Webinar on National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and Blended Learning.  

The session aims to update you on the related matters, as we issue your child/ward with his/her personal learning device under the NDLP and implement Blended Learning in Semester 2.
