On the 8 November 2019, a group of 31 students led by Mdm Koh Poh Ling, Mr Adrian Tay, Ms Sim Qin Ying, Mr Muhammad, and Mr Wang Xiao Long went on a 5 days and 4 nights Cultural Immersion Programme to Guangzhou, China. The students embarked on an exciting overseas learning journey to understand the historical, cultural, and educational context of China. Students were given opportunities to integrate classroom curriculum with real life experiences through the school and cultural visits and develop their 21st Century Competencies.

###### Highlights of the Programme:

###### School Visits:

Our students were warmly welcomed by Guangzhou International Middle School Huangpu ZWIE and Tie Yi Middle School. They attended lessons and put up Guzheng and dance performances showcasing Singapore’s multi-racial society, facilitating a meaningful exchange of cultures and strengthening international friendships.

###### Cultural Visits:

Students and staff experienced a taste of the resilience and determination Chinese martial artists possessed at the Huang Fei Hong and Ip Man Halls and explored the advancement of humankind through hands-on simulations at the Guangzhou Science and Technology Centre. They saw intricate carvings by craft masters at the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall and tried their hands at pottery in Nanfeng Kiln along Shi Wan Pottery Street. They also learnt about ancient Guangzhou at the Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King.

Through this Cultural Immersion Programme, my fellow Serangoon StaRs and I have gained many amazing experiences and valuable lessons. I was given opportunities to deliver a speech during the school’s morning assembly and put up a Guzheng performance. These experiences allowed me to build confidence, showcase my passion and strengthen my school pride. I was appointed to be a group leader. I learnt to lead and take care of my groupmates. I enjoyed the bonding with my groupmates and we appreciated the care for one another. I would like to thank and appreciate our teachers (Mdm Koh, Mr Muhammad, Ms Sim, Mr Tay, Mr Wang) for organising the trip, taking good care of us and sharing valuable life lessons.  I am inspired to continue my journey in Serangoon Sec and shine as bright as a Serangoon StaR!

I am thankful to be selected for the Cultural Immersion Programme to Guangzhou, China. I have never been to China and I wondered how living in a country with a totally different culture and heritage from us would be like. Over the span of 5 days, I learnt many things about Chinese culture and the past of Guangzhou. I experienced how two different schools conducted school programmes like morning assemblies, lessons, and mass exercises. The most memorable part of the programme was getting to form closer bonds with my friends and teachers as I got to know more about them. I also made new friends during the programme both with my fellow schoolmates and the students in the schools in Guangzhou. It was a meaningful experience for me and I learnt a lot during this Cultural Immersion Programme.
