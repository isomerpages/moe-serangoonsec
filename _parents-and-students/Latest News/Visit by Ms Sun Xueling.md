### Visit by Ms. Sun Xueling

##### Visit by Ms. Sun Xueling, Minister of State in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social and Family Development
-----------------------------------------------------
On 18 February 2021, our school had the privilege of hosting a visit by Minister of State Ms. Sun Xueling.

As part of the visit, MOS Sun joined Secondary 2H5 for a CCE lesson on mental well-being, heard firsthand from our Peer Support Leaders on peer helping and peer influencing, and learned more from our Subject Head (Student Well-Being) and Senior School Counsellor on our school’s efforts to promote the mental well-being of our Serangoon StaRs.

Through CCE lessons and discussions of relevant contemporary issues, Serangoon StaRs are equipped with knowledge and skills to manage their mental health. Teachers regularly converse one-to-one with students, and students also have access to School Counsellors. The Class Committee, Peer Support Leaders, and a buddy system in every class and CCA further supports the mental well-being of our Serangoon StaRs. Student Development Experiences such as the signature cohort programmes and initiatives such as the Class Bingo are platforms that help students deepen their bond and engagement with the school community, further strengthening their mental resilience.
