### Student Details Form (SDF) Portal

Dear Parent/Guardian,

The Ministry of Education (MOE) would like to request for an update of your information and your child’s/ward’s information via the Student Details Form (SDF) for the purpose of providing educational services to your child/ward in MOE schools.

Please submit the information through the SDF portal which can be accessed via this URL: https://pg.moe.edu.sg/forms/sdf or the QR code below. Parents/Legal Guardians may login to the SDF portal using your Singpass account to submit your information and information of your child/ward. Authorised Caregivers can only submit your own information.

 

The SDF portal can be accessed via desktop computers or mobile devices such as laptops and mobile phones.

We seek your help to complete the submission (a) annually by 31st January of each year and (b) whenever updates are required throughout the school year.  

The SDF portal will be accessible till the last day of Term 4 for you to provide timely updates of your information and/or your child’s/ward’s information.
