### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)
Serangoon Secondary School (SSS) will enhance the school's curriculum to help students strengthen digital literacy through the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). This better enables our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through **four components in the 'Find, Think, Apply and Create' framework**.

The school will roll out the use of personal learning devices (PLDs) to all Sec 1 to Sec 3 students in March 2021. Every Sec 1 to Sec 3 students will own their own school-prescribed PLD - (Lenovo 500e Error link) [Chromebook Convertible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRABMYgoQY0) which they will use in tandem with the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and other educational technology to personalise and enhance their learning. This will better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.
