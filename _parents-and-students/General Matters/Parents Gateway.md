### Parents Gateway

We are pleased to inform you that our school is onboard Parents Gateway (PG). PG is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school trips.

We would like to invite you to download the PG mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process. Please refer to [Parents Gateway Handy Guide](/files/Instructional%20Guide%20for%20Parents%20Gateway.pdf) and [FAQ](/files/FAQ%20for%20Parent%20Gateway.pdf) for a step-by-step guide and Frequently Asked Questions.

Should you require further assistance, please drop the respective form teachers or Mdm Cindy Lum at the email address: <a href = "mailto:serangoon_ss@moe.edu.sg">serangoon_ss@moe.edu.sg</a>

Thank you.
