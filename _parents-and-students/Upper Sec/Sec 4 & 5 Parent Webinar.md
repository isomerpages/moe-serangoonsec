### Sec 4 & 5 Parent Webinar

Dear Parents/Guardians,

The following slides contain useful information on how you can prepare your child/ward for his/her national examinations. The slides also offer information on the post-secondary pathways your child/ward can pursue, and the different admissions exercises and programmes available to help gain entry into a post-secondary education institution (e.g. junior college, Millennia Institute, polytechnic, ITE). This would be helpful for you as you guide your child/ward on the choices available when he/she pursues the next phase of learning after completing his/her secondary school education.
