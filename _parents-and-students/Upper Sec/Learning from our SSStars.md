### Learning From Our SSStars

Dear Students,

The link below contains recordings of some of your seniors from the Class of 2019 regarding some ITE courses, ITE EAE processes, PFP & Sec 5. This was recorded on 29 April 2020 when your seniors shared their candid experiences over Zoom. This would be helpful for you as you think about making a decision on your post-secondary education. We hope that it would provide you with a greater clarity on the write-up and interview process for the ITE EAE.
