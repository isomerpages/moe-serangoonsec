### Sec 4 &amp; 5 Parent Talk

Dear Parents/Guardians,

On 9 March 2024 (Saturday), a Parent Talk was held for parents of our Secondary 4 and 5 students.

Objectives of the sharing are:

(1) to provide information on the current educational landscape as well as the post-secondary pathways available,

(2) to partner parents in providing supervision and guidance to their child in preparation for the upcoming national examinations.

The following slides and links contain useful information on how you can prepare your child/ward for his/her national examinations. The slides and links also offer information on the post-secondary pathways your child/ward can pursue, and the different admissions exercises and programmes available to help gain entry into a post-secondary education institution (e.g. junior college, Millennia Institute, polytechnic, ITE). This would be helpful for you as you guide your child/ward on the choices available when he/she pursues the next phase of learning after completing his/her secondary school education.
