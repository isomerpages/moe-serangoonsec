### STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) ALP on Future of Transportation allows students to integrate Science and Mathematics concepts with Technology and Engineering of Transportation. It provides opportunities for students to relate their learning to transportation in real life and explore possibilities and develop the curiosity to create their model of transportation.

The Future of Transportation Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to involve students in shaping the way we move in future.
