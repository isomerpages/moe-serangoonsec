### Sec 1 3D Modelling and Printing Programme

The 3D modelling and printing programme aims to help our students understand 3D printing technology and its applications in the real world. In addition, it will enable our students toÂ learn about the principles and elements of design using an appropriate 3D modelling software.

  

All Sec 1 students are involved in the 3D modelling of different real life applications, such as the key chain and the glider, to foster the joy of learning.
