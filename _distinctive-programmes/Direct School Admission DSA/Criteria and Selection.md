The school reserves the right not to&nbsp;release the reasons for non-selection of applicants and/or the results of the aptitude test and the interview.

Parents of applicants&nbsp;**not**&nbsp;studying in MOE mainstream primary schools are to apply for a Registration Number (RGxxxxxxx) before they can apply through the DSA-Sec Portal.
