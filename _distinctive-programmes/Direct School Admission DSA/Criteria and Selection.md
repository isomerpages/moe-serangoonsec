Parents of applicants&nbsp;**not**&nbsp;studying in MOE mainstream primary schools are to apply for a Registration Number (RGxxxxxxx) before they can apply through the DSA-Sec Portal. Schools may refer them to MOE website at:&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa).

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**

**Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**

Given the prevailing national posture, the school will be conducting&nbsp;**in-person selection**&nbsp;for both DSA talent areas for 2022, with the prevailing safe management measures (SMMs) in place to ensure the safety of students and staff. Adjustments to SMMs will be made according to the national posture during the selection period.&nbsp;The selection period for schools for DSA-Sec is from 27 June to 12 September 2022.
