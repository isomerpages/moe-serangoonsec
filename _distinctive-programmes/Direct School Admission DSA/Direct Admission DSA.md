### Direct School Admission (DSA)

Serangoon Secondary School is conducting the DSA exercise for both our Distinctive Programmes, Learning for Life Programme (LLP)&nbsp;in the talent area of Community Youth Leadership entitled&nbsp;**“Project Ablaze:**&nbsp;**Harnessing Youth Leadership in the Service of Community”,**&nbsp;and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in the talent area of Programming and 3D Modelling entitled&nbsp;**“Real World Explorations in ICT”**. We warmly welcome students who are keen to develop their interest and talents in either the STEM ALP or LLP while pursuing their education in Serangoon Secondary School to participate in the DSA exercise.

**Learning for Life Programme (LLP):&nbsp;Community Youth Leadership (Project Ablaze -&nbsp;Harnessing Youth Leadership in the Service of Community)**

Aligned to the school’s Mission of Moulding Character, Igniting Passion, and Building Community, the&nbsp;LLP develops every student as a leader and provides opportunities to exercise student leadership through Values-In-Action (VIA).

The LLP follows a progressive approach towards developing leadership and service skills in students based on the following themes –

Secondary 1: Caring for our peers and school,

Secondary 2: Serving our community,

Secondary 3: Building our community, and

Secondary 4/5: Shaping our society.

The focus of leadership development at Serangoon Secondary School is also centred upon the school’s desired SHINE values of&nbsp;**S**elf-Directedness,&nbsp;**H**armony,&nbsp;**I**ntegrity, Resilie**N**ce, and&nbsp;**E**xcellence. Upon completion of his/her leadership journey in the school, every student will have grown in his/her capacity to:

(i)&nbsp;take responsibility for his/her own learning;

(ii)&nbsp;work effectively in teams, be innovative, take calculated risks, and strive for excellence;

(iii)&nbsp;lead others with confidence and&nbsp;care; and

(iv)&nbsp;influence his/her peers to bring about a positive change to the school and society through meaningful collaborations

As part of LLP, students are&nbsp;empowered&nbsp;to lead and mentor in Community Youth Leadership initiatives. They can look forward to opportunities to participate, design, and implement&nbsp;a whole array of meaningful&nbsp;and engaging community-based projects. In the process of applying their learning and leadership skills in authentic settings, our students become active contributors to the growth of our community and our nation. The school also engages partners and stakeholders to co-construct a supportive ecosystem for student leadership and student volunteerism during and beyond their school years.

  

**STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Programming and 3D Modelling (Real-World Explorations in ICT)**

Through the exploration of ICT in various contexts of&nbsp;Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), our ALP seeks to facilitate&nbsp;students’ acquisition and application of knowledge while sharpening their critical thinking skills in which logical thinking is nurtured and processing skills gained. Students will also develop an inquisitive disposition towards learning, and 21st century competencies, such as, information and communication skills and inventive thinking.

Students can look forward to engaging themselves in increasingly popular 3D Modelling and Printing in Sec 1 and enjoying exciting moments using Drones in Sec 2, where the two programmes are designed specially to pique students' interest in possibly pursuing their careers in future in industries such as Aerospace, Transportation, Infrastructure, Media, Telecommunications, Health Sciences and Architecture.&nbsp;In Sec 3, selected students continue to pursue their interest in STEM explorations.
