### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
#### Overview

Aligned to the school’s Mission of Moulding Character, Igniting Passion, and Building Community, the LLP develops every student as a leader and provides opportunities to exercise student leadership through Values in Action (VIA).

The LLP follows a progressive approach towards developing leadership and service skills in students based on the following themes:

As part of LLP, students are empowered to lead and mentor in Community Youth Leadership initiatives. They can look forward to opportunities to participate, design, and implement a whole array of meaningful and engaging community-based projects.

In the process of applying their learning and leadership skills in authentic settings, our students become active contributors to the growth of our community and our nation. The school also engages partners and stakeholders to co-construct a supportive ecosystem for student leadership and student volunteerism during and beyond their school years.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from Year 1 – 4.
