##### The School Logo
The zeal with which we pursue our mission is expressed in the symbols and colours of our badge and flag.


##### The Symbols
**Eagle** - The eagle depicted is the German Eagle that symbolises self-discipline, dignity, esteem, and power.  
  
**Lamp** - The lamp, with its radiant and glowing flame, symbolises knowledge acquired through the studying of academic subjects and a pupil's all-round development, well-being, and balanced personality. Together, they symbolise the determination with which we seek to achieve our goals.

##### The Colours

**Blue** signifies the two important and essential qualities of a good character, namely piety and sincerity.  
  
**White** embodies everything that is pure and wholesome, particularly, purity in thought, word, and deed.  
  
**Orange** represents strength - both in character and physique, integrity - strength and firmness of character, and endurance - the spirit of determination and the ability to persevere to the very end.
