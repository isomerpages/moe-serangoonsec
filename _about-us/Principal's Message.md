**A.	Introduction and Welcome**

[Slide 2] Thank you for joining us this morning at Serangoon Secondary School. We are indeed very honoured to have with us this morning Mr. Roger Foong to grace our 96th Prize Presentation Day. Today, we gather to commemorate the 96-year journey since the founding of our beloved school, and to celebrate the accomplishments of our students and staff.

I stand before you today with great pride and purpose as we witness the culmination of yet another successful academic year for our school. This is not just a day of recognition and accolades; it is a moment to reflect on the journey we have undertaken as a school and the direction in which we are headed. 

**B.	P’s Directional Setting of 54321**

[Slide 3] As a school, one fundamental purpose unites us all – and that is to equip, empower and embolden our StaRs to reach their fullest potential in life. Allow me to share my directional setting for the school to accomplish this. I call this our school’s 5-4-3-2-1.

[Slide 4] Let me start by introducing you to the number 1 in my 5-4-3-2-1. At the heart of our school community is our One StaR Family. As a One StaR Family, we work hard together to make Serangoon Secondary a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The bonds we share are not just valuable; they are the very essence of who we are and what we strive to achieve together as a school.

From this nucleus, we have our 2 Core Teams. These are our Education Officers, and our School Admin Team. Together, our school’s 2 Core Teams serve as the backbone of our school.

[Slide 5] Our School Admin Team is the heartbeat of our administrative operations, providing essential support, guidance, and expertise that keep our school running smoothly day in and day out.

[Slide 6] Our Education Officers are our unsung heroes who work hard behind the scenes and in the forefront every day to enable us to fulfil our core business as a school, that is to deliver a high-quality education to every student.
