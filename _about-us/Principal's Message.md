### Principal's Message
 

<img src="/images/photo_2022-06-20_12-54-14.jpg" style="width:183px;height:250px;margin-right:15px;" align = "Left">Serangoon Secondary School has a long and rich history of nurturing valuable members of our society. The school was founded in 1928 as Serangoon English School, and has produced a number of distinguished alumni, including a cabinet minister, senior civil servants, businessmen, and professionals.


As Serangoon Secondary’s 27th Principal, I work closely with all stakeholders to ensure that our students leave our school portals equipped with the knowledge, values, and skills needed to contribute to our society. The world we live in is fast-changing, interconnected, and highly demanding - knowledge which our students obtain in the classroom today may well be obsolete by the time they enter the workforce. It is therefore no longer sufficient to teach students; we must instead focus on teaching them to acquire knowledge. We recognise that students must be taught how to learn and to have the passion for learning. This can be accomplished by our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP), which all students participate in.

Our ALP, **_Real World Explorations in ICT_**, uses ‘The Future of Transportation’ as a context for applying the academic knowledge that students will acquire from classroom teaching and providing hands-on training and practical experience for students. In addition, our LLP, **_Harnessing Student Leadership in the Service of Community_**, provides students with real-life experiences to develop character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, and strengthen their leadership skills. Both ALP and LLP are distinctive programmes which would enhance our students’ school experience and build our school identity.

We seek to work in partnership with parents and alumni to organise meaningful learning experiences for our students, and tap on the vast pool of experience and expertise which our stakeholders offer. As stakeholders with a common interest in developing our students, it is essential that parents, alumni, and staff work closely together to nurture our students into good citizens and prepare them to meet the challenges of the future. I am committed to working closely with each and every one of you during my term as Principal of Serangoon Secondary School. Together, we empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and the good of others.
