In Serangoon Secondary School, we are committed to ensuring that our teachers receive the support they need to provide the best possible education to our students. We believe that investing in the professional development and well-being of our staff is essential to achieving the Desired Outcomes of Education.

Professional development is a critical component of our commitment to excellence. We recognise that the quality of an educational system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers. That's why we prioritise ongoing training and development to keep our teachers up-to-date with the latest teaching methods, technologies, and best practices.  We use the SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd), a professional development roadmap to improve their competencies and encourage lifelong learning. Through SFEd, teachers are continuously enhancing their skills and knowledge needed to deliver high-quality education and prepare students for the future.

We also understand the importance of developing our Executive and Administration Staff and Allied Educators to meet the school's goals, as they play a critical role in supporting our teachers and students, and we are committed to providing them with the resources and training they need to excel in their roles.

In addition to professional development, the well-being needs of our staff are equally important.  We believe in taking a holistic approach to staff well-being, addressing their Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, and Social (PIES) needs. We encourage our staff to prioritise their health and wellness, and we provide resources  and organise social activities to support them. By taking care of the “PIES” of our staff, we hope to empower our staff to continue to strive for quality education and administrative excellence for our students.

In conclusion, investing in the professional development and well-being of our staff is essential to achieving our educational goals. We are committed to providing our teachers and non-teaching staff with the resources and support they need to excel in their roles and provide our students with a world-class education.

Thank you for your partnership as we work together to create a vibrant and successful learning community who Seek to grow, strive to excel and Serve with honour.
