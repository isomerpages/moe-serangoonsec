We are 95 this year and going strong! Our strength lies in us being a closely knitted family bonded by a strong spirit of teamwork, collaboration, and congeniality.  This pervasive school culture has created a conducive and nurturing environment for the growth of our students.

We believe an education that develops the imagination of a child is richer than one that equips the child with pure knowledge. While knowledge is important for the present, imagination is what moves individuals, societies, and cultures forward. Hence, we put a premium on promoting and growing an innovative mindset in our students through selective programs. We encourage our students to be creative and pioneering in their thoughts, while emphasising the importance of values and character that will serve as a moral compass in an uncertain and fast changing environment.

While it is common to expect the school to do all the teaching, we firmly believe that the parents are the child’s first and foremost educator. The character building and values inculcation starts at home and parents play a vital role in developing every child into a good citizen. Therefore, we had always strived to build a strong parent-teacher relationship which is essential for the holistic development of our students. I would like to welcome all our parents to play an active role in their child’s education process and be a keen participant in our school life. Together, we can empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and the good of others.
