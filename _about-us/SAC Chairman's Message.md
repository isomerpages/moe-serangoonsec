It is with great privilege and honour that I pen this message to mark the 95th Anniversary of Serangoon Secondary, and celebrate the remarkable contributions and achievements of students, staff, and stakeholders of the school. This is aptly captured by its 95th Anniversary Celebrations theme – ‘Constellations: Celebrating S³taRs’, with the S³ in S³taRs representing the Students, Staff and Stakeholders.   This theme embodies the spirit of unity and collaboration that has been the foundation of the school’s success over the years.

As we celebrate the school’s 95th milestone, let us pause for a moment to reflect on its incredible journey of the last 5 years. This year’s theme of ‘Constellations’ in fact builds upon the theme of its 90th Anniversary five years ago, which is ‘Constellation’ (in the singular form). Five years ago, the image of Serangoon Secondary School’s students as a group of stars charting the way forward was a powerful one. 2018 to 2021 was a period of change and transformation for the school against the backdrop of changes in the MOE landscape – from the introduction of Subject Based Banding to the integration of SkillsFuture Singapore.

But when the school celebrated its 90th Anniversary 5 years ago, it could not have possibly anticipated the shape of things to come. COVID-19 was a transforming and humbling force. So powerful was this force that it sped up digital transformation in schools by several years. The school, its students and its teachers had to adapt and innovate to ensure learning could continue and students continue to receive the care and support that they needed through the circuit breaker period.

I am heartened to hear of how, today, making the important connections between what students learn in the classroom and the real world is part of the fabric of teaching and learning for teachers of Serangoon Secondary School.

Students of Serangoon Secondary, or StaRs as you are affectionately called, are equipped with real world understandings to help you make more informed choices about your educational and career opportunities.

This approach to teaching &amp; learning is also supported by the strong foundation that the school has laid for its teachers’ professional upskilling in e-pedagogy. Quality learning experiences are designed using active learning processes to engage students. At the same time, the school works to establish a strong partnership with all its stakeholders.

In the next leg of Serangoon Secondary School’s journey of 5 years counting down to its Centenary Celebrations in 2028 —with changes ahead such as Full Subject Based Banding and the introduction of a new national common exam in 2027— more than ONE Constellation or Group of Stars will need to come together to embrace future challenges.

These other constellations are the parents, alumni, school advisory committee, the community at large, schools as well as industrial partners that it works closely with to achieve the school vision of Resilient Individuals, Passionate Learners, and Active Contributors.

Allow me to commend Serangoon Secondary School for having come this far since 1928. Through this journey of 95 years, the school has remained steadfast in its commitment to provide a sound education and enrich the lives of its StaRs. May your students continue to reach for the stars in all that they do – with the dedication, hard work, and unwavering support of everyone in the Serangoon Secondary School family from the school leaders, teachers, Alumni, parents, and school partners.

Here's to many more years of success and achievement for Serangoon Secondary School.
