### Vice-Principal's Message

2023 promises to be an exciting year for a few reasons. First, we will be celebrating our 95th birthday. Yes, you read it right - Serangoon Secondary School (SSS) is 95 years old this year! Not many government schools could withstand the test of time as they weather the changing socio-economic and geographical factors that affect the student population intake, forcing some to either close or merge. Our student population has remained healthy over the past few years with SSSâ€™ unique culture of care for students and staff together with its offerings of STEM Applied Learning Programme of â€˜Drone Programming and 3D Modellingâ€™ as well as Learn for Life Programme of â€˜Harnessing Student Leadership in the Service of Communityâ€™. 

Embarking on the journey of Full Subject-Based Banding is yet another reason for our excitement. We are now better geared towards catering to the different strengths and interests of our Serangoon StaRs (we lovingly call our students â€˜StaRsâ€™ because we believe that they can not only glow with enthusiasm in what they do in SSS, and pride in belonging to the school community but also SHINE (acronym for our school values) brightly by being self-directed, learning together by getting along well with others, anchored by integrity while remaining resilient and putting their best foot forward) and be given more opportunities to learn and interact together in common curriculum subjects such as Art, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and PE. 

Finally, with the school leadership team led by the new Principal, Mr Chen, and the renewed focus on partnership and staff well-being, the school will be further energised to tap upon these two important enablers in augmenting its efforts to help our StaRs achieve greater heights! Let me thus welcome all, parents, as well as our other stakeholders to journey with our Serangoon family as we 'Seek to grow, Strive to excel, and Serve with honour in the year ahead!â€™ ðŸ˜Š
