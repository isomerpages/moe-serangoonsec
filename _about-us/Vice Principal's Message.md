**Our StaRs Shine Bright!**

I am deeply honoured to be appointed as Vice-Principal of Serangoon Secondary School, a school which prides itself as being a place for each of our **Serangoon StaRs** to discover their passion, flourish and SHINE brightly for themselves and for the people around them. As our students embody the school values of **self-directedness**, **harmony**, **integrity**, **resilience** and **excellence**, they will grow into the resilient individuals, passionate learners and active contributors that we envision them to be.

Beyond pursuing their academic goals in the classroom, we are committed to helping our students develop a strong value system for ethical decision making and deepening their sense of service and agency for leading change in their community. In addition, as the world around us becomes increasingly more complex and uncertain, we are also focused in our efforts to nurture future-ready competencies in our StaRs, helping them to gain the necessary dispositions and skillsets to navigate their paths as they graduate from our school. These commitments toward our students’ holistic growth are reflected in the choice of the school’s signature programmes of Community Youth Leadership (LLP) and STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP).

None of this would be possible without the sincere care and hard work of our teachers and colleagues. Their heart for our students shines through clearly in the work that they do to come together in their teams to understand and support each of our students. This would also not be possible without the trust, support and partnership of our parents and community partners who, like us, believe that it takes a whole village to raise each child, and work closely in tandem with our school to support our StaRs’ learning and growth. 

I look forward to working closely with my colleagues, our parents and community partners in the years ahead, to forge in the heart of each of our StaRs the elements for a brighter tomorrow!

***Seek to Grow, Strive to Excel, Serve with Honour.***

**Nurturing Our Shining StaRs**

I am deeply honoured to join Serangoon Secondary School as Vice-Principal, a school with a long-established history that has grown from strength to strength over the years. I am inspired by the school’s unwavering commitment to nurturing each Serangoon StaR into a resilient individual, passionate learner, and active contributor, and pledge to work closely with my colleagues, our parents, and community partners to equip, empower, and embolden our StaRs to reach their fullest potential in life, anchored in our SHINE values of self-directedness, harmony, integrity, resilience, and excellence.

As a school, we are committed to the holistic development of our StaRs, centred on a framework that spans the five Domains of Holistic Education—Moral, Intellectual, Physical, Social, and Aesthetic Domains—enacted through high-quality programmes.

Our academic departments are intentional in leveraging curriculum design and pedagogical approaches, including learning with technology, to ignite our students’ passion for learning and deepen their subject mastery. Beyond academic learning, we also aim to nurture in our students a strong value system that will guide their ethical decision-making and develop their sense of other-centredness, so that they can lead their lives responsibly and contribute actively to their communities. As our world rapidly evolves, we also seek to develop future-ready skills and dispositions in our StaRs, enabling them to confidently navigate their paths after their education with us, and learn throughout life. Our commitment to our students’ holistic development is evident in our school’s signature programmes, such as Community Youth Leadership (LLP) and the STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which are designed to be authentic, varied, and engaging. These programmes spark curiosity, nurture a joy for learning, and build the 21st-century competencies necessary to thrive in an evolving world.

None of the work we do would be possible without our One StaR family, comprising our teachers and colleagues from the School Administrative Team, who work in synergy to nurture and support every one of our StaRs. Our efforts are also enriched by the trust, support, and partnership of our parents and community partners, whose active involvement reinforces the learning of values, skills, and knowledge in our students, allowing them to SHINE both in school and beyond.

It is my privilege to join this vibrant community, and I look forward to working alongside everyone in our collective endeavour to nurture each and every one of our Serangoon StaRs to their fullest potential.
