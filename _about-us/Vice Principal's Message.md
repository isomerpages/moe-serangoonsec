**Our StaRs Shine Bright!**

I am deeply honoured to be appointed as Vice-Principal of Serangoon Secondary School, a school which prides itself as being a place for each of our **Serangoon StaRs** to discover their passion, flourish and SHINE brightly for themselves and for the people around them. As our students embody the school values of **self-directedness**, **harmony**, **integrity**, **resilience** and **excellence**, they will grow into the resilient individuals, passionate learners and active contributors that we envision them to be.

Beyond pursuing their academic goals in the classroom, we are committed to helping our students develop a strong value system for ethical decision making and deepening their sense of service and agency for leading change in their community. In addition, as the world around us becomes increasingly more complex and uncertain, we are also focused in our efforts to nurture future-ready competencies in our StaRs, helping them to gain the necessary dispositions and skillsets to navigate their paths as they graduate from our school. These commitments toward our students’ holistic growth are reflected in the choice of the school’s signature programmes of Community Youth Leadership (LLP) and STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP).

None of this would be possible without the sincere care and hard work of our teachers and colleagues. Their heart for our students shines through clearly in the work that they do to come together in their teams to understand and support each of our students. This would also not be possible without the trust, support and partnership of our parents and community partners who, like us, believe that it takes a whole village to raise each child, and work closely in tandem with our school to support our StaRs’ learning and growth. 

I look forward to working closely with my colleagues, our parents and community partners in the years ahead, to forge in the heart of each of our StaRs the elements for a brighter tomorrow!

***Seek to Grow, Strive to Excel, Serve with Honour.***
