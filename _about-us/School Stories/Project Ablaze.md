### Project Ablaze

Through taking part in community-based projects, students in the school learn about the role they can play as active citizens, and how they can contribute to the growth of the community and nation. 

  

It was all business for Secondary Three students of the school, as they ventured for the first time into the homes of the less-privileged elderly living in one-room rental flats – with an important mission.

As part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) named _Project Ablaze_, and in partnership with Jia Ying Senior Activity Centre and the Housing and Development Board (HDB), these Secondary Three students – armed with brooms and mops – took on the herculean task of cleaning the flats for an afternoon.

In those few hours, the students swept and mopped the floor, wiped the windows, scrubbed the toilets, and tidied up the flats. 

Once the cleaning mission was completed, the students spent the rest of the afternoon interacting with the elderly, many of whom live alone. Language barriers notwithstanding, the students managed to strike up simple conversations with the elderly, who welcomed their company.

The focus of the school’s _Project Ablaze_ is on Community Youth Leadership. Students are given opportunities to lead and serve the community through designing and implementing community-based projects.

At the lower secondary levels, students are sensitised to the needs of their school community and the wider community. At the upper secondary levels, as in the case for these Secondary Three students, they apply their knowledge and skills in student-initiated projects.
