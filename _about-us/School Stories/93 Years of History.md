### 93 Years of History

Serangoon Secondary School may be tucked away at the outskirts of Upper Serangoon, and nestled in the HDB heartland, but did you know that the school has been around for 93 years? In fact, this year marks the school’s 93rd anniversary.

The school had its beginnings in 1928 as _Serangoon English School_, housed in a double-storeyed building along Simon Road. In 1949, the school became a full school offering education from Primary One to Cambridge School Certificate.

In 1957, it was converted into a secondary school serving residents of Upper Serangoon district. In 1967, the school relocated to Lowland Road and was renamed Serangoon Secondary School.

In 2001, Serangoon Secondary moved to its present premises at 11, Upper Serangoon View. Its students hail from the neighbouring Punggol, Sengkang, Hougang, and Upper Serangoon heartlands.
