### Healthy Eating, Healthy Relationships

![](/images/Healthy%20Food%201.jpg) 

Making the subjects in Nutrition and Food Studies (NFS) come alive through activities that also connect the communities within the school, all while promoting healthier eating habits!  

Food has always been a universal bond between people.  

With this in mind, in 2017, we launched our first parent-child baking session conducted by the Nutrition and Food Studies (NFS) teachers. Our teachers also shared helpful tips with parents to make recipes healthier!

The success of this event paved the way for other ideas to promote healthy eating within the school community. As a post-exam activity, selected Secondary Two students took part in the annual Craft & Technology programme. With guidance from their NFS teachers, they interviewed their form teachers on their favourite foods and, with the information collected, experimented with ways to modify recipes to create healthier versions of these foods.

At the end of the programme, the lovingly-prepared foods were presented to their form teachers -- an apt way to express gratitude for their care and concern!

This year, the NFS teachers are planning a food-sampling event where selected Secondary Three Food & Nutrition students will be cooking healthy foods using recipes they have created, sharing them with the school during lunchtime. Then, we will vote for our own Serangoon Secondary MasterChef!

Well-received recipes will also be highlighted to canteen vendors to expand our canteen menus to include more healthy choices. The recipes featured in this sampling event will be made available on the school’s website to be shared with online visitors.

Through these efforts, our students learn the important message of making healthy eating a lifelong habit while strengthening bonds!
