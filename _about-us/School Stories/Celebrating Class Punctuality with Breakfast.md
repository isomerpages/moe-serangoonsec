### Celebrating Class Punctuality with Breakfast

While some schools might be content to give out stars for punctuality, our school’s STAR award encourages punctuality with a delicious breakfast!

The STAR Award for class punctuality was implemented to instil the important habit of punctuality in all our students. At the end of every term, classes which meet the award criteria or show the most improvement in punctuality records get to chow down with their teachers and friends at a feast of local breakfast treats!

Thrilled by the prospects of enjoying a hearty breakfast together at the end of every term, classmates and form teachers rally together, in the hope of attaining this award. As this award is given out at the end of every term, classes which do not make the mark are motivated to try harder the following term.

In Term 1 2018, one year after our scheme started, ALL our enthusiastic Sec One classes received the award and had a great breakfast treat!
