**Nurturing Our Shining StaRs**

I am deeply honoured to join Serangoon Secondary School as Vice-Principal, a school with a long-established history that has grown from strength to strength over the years. I am inspired by the school’s unwavering commitment to nurturing each Serangoon StaR into a resilient individual, passionate learner, and active contributor, and pledge to work closely with my colleagues, our parents, and community partners to equip, empower, and embolden our StaRs to reach their fullest potential in life, anchored in our SHINE values of self-directedness, harmony, integrity, resilience, and excellence.

As a school, we are committed to the holistic development of our StaRs, centred on a framework that spans the five Domains of Holistic Education—Moral, Intellectual, Physical, Social, and Aesthetic Domains—enacted through high-quality programmes.

Our academic departments are intentional in leveraging curriculum design and pedagogical approaches, including learning with technology, to ignite our students’ passion for learning and deepen their subject mastery. Beyond academic learning, we also aim to nurture in our students a strong value system that will guide their ethical decision-making and develop their sense of other-centredness, so that they can lead their lives responsibly and contribute actively to their communities. As our world rapidly evolves, we also seek to develop future-ready skills and dispositions in our StaRs, enabling them to confidently navigate their paths after their education with us, and learn throughout life. Our commitment to our students’ holistic development is evident in our school’s signature programmes, such as Community Youth Leadership (LLP) and the STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which are designed to be authentic, varied, and engaging. These programmes spark curiosity, nurture a joy for learning, and build the 21st-century competencies necessary to thrive in an evolving world.

None of the work we do would be possible without our One StaR family, comprising our teachers and colleagues from the School Administrative Team, who work in synergy to nurture and support every one of our StaRs. Our efforts are also enriched by the trust, support, and partnership of our parents and community partners, whose active involvement reinforces the learning of values, skills, and knowledge in our students, allowing them to SHINE both in school and beyond.

It is my privilege to join this vibrant community, and I look forward to working alongside everyone in our collective endeavour to nurture each and every one of our Serangoon StaRs to their fullest potential.

**Seek to Grow, Strive to Excel, Serve with Honour.**

I am glad and honoured to join the Serangoon Family.  As I step into this positive and caring community, I am filled with excitement for the journey ahead and the potential that lies within each member of our school.

At Serangoon Secondary School, we hold a steadfast belief that together, we can empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, not only for personal growth but for the betterment of society. Our vision extends beyond academic excellence; we aim to nurture individuals who are anchored in strong values, equipped to navigate the uncertainties of the future with confidence and integrity. In a world of constant change, these values will serve as a compass, guiding our students through challenges and opportunities alike.

I am committed for each Serangoon StaR to have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to shine their brightest, and to be well-positioned for a future filled with promise. Together, we will create an environment where curiosity is encouraged, talents are nurtured, and dreams are pursued with passion. As we embark on this exciting chapter, I look forward to witnessing the remarkable achievements of our students and the positive impact they will undoubtedly make in the world.
