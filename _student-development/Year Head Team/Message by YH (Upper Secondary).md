### Message by Year Head (Upper Secondary)

<img src="/images/School%20Management%20Team/Lum%20Cindy.jpg" style="width:215px; height:315px; margin-right:20px; border:0.5px solid Gainsboro; padding: 5px" align="Left">

In SSS, we believe that every student is unique, and we want to nurture each child to his or her fullest potential. We adopt a thematic approach in our holistic development of students. These themes are developmentally progressive with a we-statement to help our Serangoon StaRs understand their level of focus. Each theme is also aligned to our school values and motto with a sphere of influence which we want to see in our students. The respective level themes are very much aligned to supporting the transitioning and growing up challenges faced by students in their secondary school journeys.

For the Upper Secondary levels, the themes are as follows:
* Sec 3: We strive to impact and inspire others.
* Sec 4/5: We strive for excellence and serve others with honour.

<b><u>Secondary 3: We strive to impact and inspire others</u></b>

As the StaRs progress to be the seniors of the school, they learn to impact and inspire others through the following key programmes:

<u>Sec 3 StaRs Programme</u>

A 4-day-3-night camp that allows our StaRs to strengthen  harmonious relationships with peers and form teachers, develop inter-dependence and social cohesion and harness diverse strengths to achieve group goals through the  outdoor adventure activities (e.g. orienteering, kayaking expedition).

<u>Sec 3 NRIC Presentation Ceremony</u>

All 15-year old students will participate in this formal ceremony in school, which signals their coming of age and their role and responsibilities as Singaporean youths. This would also be an opportune time to reflect on their National Education experiences and journey through the years.

<u>Sec 3 Taking the Lead</u>

The iconic cohort programme whereby the Secondary 3 StaRs assume seniorship in the school after the graduating cohort steps down from their CCA and prepares for their national examinations in the 2nd semester. Each Secondary 3 class will plan and prepare items to appreciate and encourage their Secondary 4 and 5 seniors for their final lap in the secondary school educational journey.

<u>Learning journeys and workshops</u>

During the course of the year, the Secondary 3 StaRs attend learning journeys and workshops that provide students with rich and authentic opportunities beyond the classroom. Our school partners the community to enhance and enrich these experiences. For example, we collaborated with the People’s Association for our StaRs to attend a learning journey by Cloop, where they understood the importance of sustainability by reducing fashion consumption and waste in the community.

<b><u>Secondary 4 &amp; 5: We strive for excellence and serve others with honour</u></b>

As the StaRs progress to the final lap of their educational journey in SSS, they learn to strive for excellence and serve others with honour through the following key programmes:

<u>Secondary 4 &amp; 5 StaRs Programme</u>

The StaRs will attend a 4 day programme which will equip them with skills to motivate, and prepare for national examination, as well as to prepare them for the post-secondary pathways (e.g. interview skills, writing of personal statement). They will also attend seminars and learning journeys to the various institutions (e.g. polytechnics, junior colleges). In addition, they will also get to enjoy team bonding activities to deepen their relationships with their peers and teachers. The programme will end with the signature activity of archery, where we hope that our StaRs will learn and apply the skills of aiming high and achieving the marks in their lives.

<u>Values In Action Programme</u>

As part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), the Secondary 4 and 5 StaRs take ownership of their service and contribution to the community. They plan, design and implement meaningful and engaging community-based programmes. For example, a group of students raised awareness for the Yellow Ribbon Singapore by setting up booths and packing care packs for ex-offenders and their families.

<u>Graduation Ceremony and Prom Night</u>

The Secondary 4 and 5 StaRs celebrate the end of their memorable journey in SSS at the Graduation Ceremony and Prom Night. This year, these 2 events were held in the school hall with heartfelt words and well wishes penned from staff, parents and fellow StaRs. At the Graduation Ceremony, the StaRs received a collar badge that symbolizes the well wishes for the next phase of their journey and the everlasting memories of SSS that they may carry for the rest of their lives. At the Prom Night, they enjoyed a wonderful dinner in the company of their peers and teachers before parting ways and embarking on new adventures.

In summary, the above level programmes help hone our students’ social and emotional competencies and enable them to grow holistically. We nurture a culture of care among students by fostering strong and meaningful relationships with their teachers and peers. Strong school-home partnership is also critical to provide the effective environments for our students to develop through structures and routines. The teachers will partner the parents as trusted adults who will journey with our students, through the ups and downs as they navigate this journey. Together, we empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and good of others.
