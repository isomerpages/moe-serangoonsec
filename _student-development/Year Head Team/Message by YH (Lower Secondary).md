In SSS, we adopt a thematic approach in the holistic development of our students. These themes are developmentally progressive with we-statements to help our Serangoon StaRs understand the respective level focus. Each theme is also aligned to our school values and motto with a sphere of influence which we want to see in our students.

For the Lower Secondary levels, the themes are as follows:
* Sec 1: We seek to learn and grow together.
* Sec 2: We strive to build harmony and be team players.

<b><u>Sec 1: We seek to learn and grow together</u></b>

As a fraternity, we have reached another significant milestone with the implementation of Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB). We recognise that each child is unique, with his/her own interests, preferences and strengths. FSBB is part of the shift to give our students more flexibility in the learning of different subjects, together with more social mixing to interact with other peers.

We are intentional in creating multiple opportunities for them to interact and learn with peers of different backgrounds, strengths, and interests. For Sec 1 StaRs joining the SSS family, they will learn to appreciate diversity and develop holistically as a cohort through different key programmes:

<u>Sec 1 Orientation</u>

The orientation programme is tailored to help our new StaRs form new friendships and settle in the new environment, guided by their FTs and seniors. Various team building activities are conducted to foster class spirit and Sec 1 StaRs will also learn strategies to cope with the demands during transition.

<u>Sec 1 StaRs Programme</u>

The 4-days-2-nights camp is our iconic cohort-level student development experience. Through various activities such as dragon boating, orienteering and team building games, Sec 1 StaRs develop both personal and team excellence and resilience. The camp is a good platform to foster a positive class culture. There are many opportunities for students to reflect on and connect what they have learnt from camp experiences to their daily lives.

<u>Learning Journeys and Workshops</u>

During the course of the year, the Secondary 1 StaRs are also engaged in meaningful activities such as learning journeys and workshops to supplement their learning. For example, Sec 1 StaRs participated in a Humanities Learning Journey at Sentosa, learnt about forensics investigation work through a science workshop and picked up a new sport (bowling/ kinball/ skating) through the Sports Education Programme. We are fortunate to collaborate with various external stakeholders to curate these learning opportunities and look forward to more partnerships.

<b><u>Sec 2: We strive to build harmony and be team players</u></b>

With a stronger sense of belonging to the school and more awareness of one’s interests, Sec 2 StaRs can look forward to more experiences beyond the classroom that will shape their education and career aspirations. 

<u>Sec 2 StaRs Programme</u>

Sec 2 StaRs will be enrolled into various Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) related courses to broaden the learning experiences and increase students' exposure to opportunities in STEM fields. Students can benefit from the various Applied Learning modules, such as F1 Automobile Engineering and 3D Product Design. The StaRs Programme will eventually conclude with a showcase by students to share their learnings and insights.

<u>Sec 2 Subject Allocation Exercise</u>

Frequent engagements throughout the year are held for students, together with their family members to prepare our Sec 2 StaRs for the SAE processes. Beyond these engagements, the StaRs’ Education and Career Guidance (ECG) journeys are also supported by subject talks and career sharings by external stakeholders from different fields.

<u>Sec 2 Mark of Transition</u>

To mark their 2 years journey in SSS, Sec 2 StaRs participate in the Mark of Transition activity on the last school day to commemorate the end of Lower Secondary years. More importantly, it is a day to celebrate their growth and friendships as they transit to Upper Secondary.

The respective level themes are very much aligned to supporting the transitioning and growing up challenges faced by students in their secondary school journeys. Beyond academics, the various student development experiences help hone our students’ social and emotional competencies and enable them to grow holistically. We nurture a culture of care among students by recognising and reinforcing the importance for students to have positive relationships with their peers. Through peer support structures such as empowering our Peer Support Leaders, students learn to be kind, compassionate and empathetic while also strengthening their social networks of support.

The various interactions, programmes and activities present valuable learning opportunities for students to grow in character and inspire the joy of learning. Every student is unique, and we want to nurture each child to his or her fullest potential. To do so, strong school-home partnership is critical to provide the effective environments for our students to develop through structures and routines. The teachers will partner the parents as trusted adults who will journey with our students, through the ups and downs as they navigate this journey. Together, we empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and good of others.
