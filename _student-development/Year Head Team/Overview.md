### Year Head Team

At Serangoon Secondary School (SSS), we believe every student is unique and capable of growth. To nurture each Serangoon StaR holistically, we adopt a **developmentally progressive, thematic approach** anchored on our school values and motto.

Each level is guided by a clear *we-statement* that shapes students’ focus and supports their social, emotional and character development throughout their secondary school journey.

Across their four to five years with us, our StaRs learn to:
<b>
* grow with others,
* build harmony and teamwork,
* inspire and influence, and
* strive for excellence.
</b>

This journey is supported through intentional structures, caring relationships and strong school–home partnerships.
