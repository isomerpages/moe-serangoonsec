### CCA Leaders

Our CCA leaders work closely with the CCA teachers-in-charge and instructors/coaches in the planning and execution of the CCA programme. They work closely with members to achieve CCA-specific goals. They play an important role in upholding discipline and forge camaraderie amongst members.

To ensure that our student leaders are well-equipped to take on their appointments, our CCA teachers-in-charge incorporate the necessary leadership training and mentoring into the overall CCA programme.

#### National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA)

The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) is an exciting self-development programme available to all young people between the ages of 13 and 30. It is a holistic, balanced and non-competitive programme of voluntary leisure-time activities, designed to provide our young people with a platform to develop personal qualities and skills to make a difference to themselves, their communities and the world.

Students are given the opportunity to take part in NYAA in Secondary 2 and 3. Their respective CCA teachers will mentor and guide them for this leadership journey.

The objectives of the programme are: 
* To encourage young people to develop personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to themselves, to society and to the nation.
* To provide students with opportunities and platforms to discover interests and talents; and to develop their potential to the fullest.
