### Student Leadership

![](/images/student-leadership.jpg)

The focus of student leadership development in Serangoon Secondary School is centred upon the school’s desired SHINE values of **S**elf-Directedness, **H**armony, **I**ntegrity, Resilie**N**ce, and **E**xcellence. Upon completion of his/her leadership journey in the school, every student will have grown in his/her capacity to:

*   take responsibility for his/her own learning;
    
*   work effectively in teams, be innovative, take calculated risks, and strive for excellence;
    
*   lead others with confidence and care; and
    
*   influence his/her peers to bring about a positive change to the school and society through meaningful collaborations

The school provides leadership opportunities for four different groups of student leaders (i.e. Prefects, CCA Leaders, Class Committee, and Peer Support Leaders) to meet the aspirations of students with leadership potential, and to further develop their leadership competencies.
