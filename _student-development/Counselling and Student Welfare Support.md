Mental Wellness in Serangoon Secondary School is about providing our students with a safe space to share their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health issues. We strive to empower our students towards positive help-seeking behaviours to improve their mental well-being.

Positive help-seeking behaviours demonstrate the courage and strength to seek ways to understand oneself better, to get support for help to make things better and take a step towards improving our well-being and happiness.
