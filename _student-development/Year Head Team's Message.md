### Message by the Year Head Team

In SSS, we adopt a thematic approach in our holistic development of students. These themes are developmentally progressive with a we-statement to help our Serangoon StaRs understand their level focus. Each theme is also aligned to our school values and motto with a sphere of influence which we want to see in our students. 

<ul><li>Sec 1: We seek to learn &amp; grow together.

</li><li>Sec 2: We strive to build harmony and be team players.

</li><li>Sec 3: We strive to impact and inspire others.

</li><li>Sec 4/5: We strive for excellence and serve others with honour.</li></ul>

The respective level themes are very much aligned to supporting the transitioning and growing up challenges faced by students in their secondary school journeys. Beyond academics, students participate in various student development experiences such as outdoor adventure learning camps, applied learning modules, arts exposure and learning journeys. These programmes help hone our studentsâ€™ social and emotional competencies and enable them to grow holistically. We nurture a culture of care among students by recognising and reinforcing the importance for students to have positive relationships with their peers. Through peer support structures such as empowering our Peer Support Leaders, students learn to be kind, compassionate and empathetic while also strengthening their social networks of support.

The various interactions, programmes and activities present valuable learning opportunities for students to grow in character and inspire the joy of learning. Every student is unique, and we want to nurture each child to his or her fullest potential. To do so, strong school-home partnership is critical to provide the effective environments for our students to develop through structures and routines. The teachers will partner the parents as trusted adults who will journey with our students, through the ups and downs as they navigate this journey. Together, we empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and good of others.
