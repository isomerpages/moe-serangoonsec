### Overview of Student Development Programmes

In Serangoon Secondary School, our programmes are designed to foster holistic growth and empower students to SHINE throughout their secondary school journey. From orientation to graduation, students are engaged in a structured progression of learning and enrichment activities through the 5 domains of development, i.e. 德 (moral), 智(intellectual), 体 (physical), 群 (social) and 美 (aesthetics).

Here’s a closer look at what our student development programmes entail:

**a.	Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**

<li>Our CCE curriculum is anchored on MOE’s philosophy, our school’s SHINE values, and level themes and it is enacted intentionally through various platforms [e.g. CCE lessons that comprise content areas such as National Education, Metal Health, Values-in-Action (VIA), Student Leadership Development Programme].
</li><li>Our students are engaged in experiential learning and put into practice values and social emotional competencies taught. We envision a deepening of their learning and broadening of their spheres of influences, in alignment to our level themes.
<br>o	Sec 1: Understanding and Leading Self. 
<br>o	Sec 2: Understanding Others and Working Together. 
<br>o	Sec 3: Impacting and Inspiring Others. 
<br>o	Sec 4 and 5: Striving for Excellence and Looking Ahead.
</li><li>In addition, Education and Career Guidance Programme (ECG) is strongly emphasised to support our students in discovering their strengths and interests and exploring their goals and aspirations. </li>

**b.	Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)**

<li>We believe that CCAs provide a holistic education that prepares students for success in an ever-changing world. 
</li><li>Our diverse array of CCAs offers students opportunities to explore their passions and develop various skills. Through engaging activities and projects, students develop essential skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
</li><li>CCAs at Serangoon Secondary are not just extracurricular; they are an integral part of the school experience.
</li><li>Students are encouraged to participate actively in their chosen CCAs, taking on roles and contributively positively to the school community.
</li><li>We are thrilled to share that through dedication, passion and hard work, our students have excelled in various CCAs, showing their talents, and making us proud.</li>

**c.	Level Programmes**

<li>Our level programmes are designed to the address the unique developmental needs of students at each stage of their secondary education. They built students’ sense of belonging to school, further augmenting student motivation and engagement. 
<br>o	The Sec 1 Orientation and Investiture in Semester 1 inducted our new students into the school.</li>

“One thing that I learned from the Sec 1 Orientation is teamwork. One memorable activity was a game involving building a house with a deck of cards. I really enjoyed it because we get to have fun and put our differences aside and come together to build a house and to win the game.” <b>- Quek Zhi Xiang Theodore, 1SD7 (2023)</b>

<br>o	Sec 2 students went through a Mark of Transition activity at the end of lower secondary. 
<br>o	Sec 3 students went through the Taking the Lead programme to receive the leadership mantle from their seniors. 
<br>o	Sec 4 and 5 students attended a heartwarming Graduation Ceremony and a memorable Prom Night at the end of the year.

<li>The highlight of our student-designed experience is the iconic StaRs programme. The 4-day programme was designed to meet students’ social emotional needs and holistic development.

o	For our Sec 1 and 3 students, they will attend outdoor adventure learning camps. Through various activities, such as dragon boating, orienteering, hiking, our students develop skills such as resilience and teamwork.</li>

“The Sec 3 Outdoor Activity Learning Camp was an enriching 4-Day 3-Night experience for my peers and me. It allowed me to pick up essential outdoor education skills and strengthen the relationships I have with my peers. Through the camp, I learnt that it is important to be respectful towards others and work together to achieve group goals. I enjoyed kayaking and the campfire night the most.” <b>- Mohamed Raihan Bin Mohamed Hisham, 3I1 (2023)</b>
	
<br>o	For our Sec 2 students, the programme focuses on Applied Learning Modules, where they will have experiential learning through workshops and learning journeys. They will be able to pursue areas of interest that take them beyond the curriculum.

“We learnt how to collaborate our ideas and work as a team while participating in the Sec 2 StaRs Programme. The obstacles we faced allowed us to grow and strengthen our team spirits. We learnt about resilience, hard work, and time management through the StaRs Programme.”* <b>- Banga Rashika and Bhavya Bijoy, 2H6 (2023)</b>

<br>o	For our Sec 4 and 5 students, the programme focuses on ECG on post-secondary education options and interview skills, as well as VIA projects where they initiate and advocate an area in which they would like to serve.

<li>We also catered to students’ needs, strengths, and interests through a myriad of activities such as the Learning Weeks. The twice-yearly Learning Weeks included hands-on authentic Mathematics activities, Science learning journeys, physical games building students’ teamwork and class spirit, Music Showcase and more.</li>

**d.	Customised Support** 

<li>As part of our ongoing commitment to proving a caring and enabling learning environment, we offer customised programmes to students who may require additional support in specific areas.
<br>o	Orion StaRs After School Engagement aims at providing students with meaningful engagement after school through interest-based activities (e.g. sport, craft etc.). It also aims to enhance students’ personal and social and emotional competencies and strengthen peer relationships and teacher-student relationships.
<br>o	Mentoring Programmes are planned and conducted in partnership with various community partners, such as Bethesda Care, to develop students’ personal and social emotional competencies and equip them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values. 
<br>o	Applied Learning Modules at ITEs and Polytechnics are short courses provided for the Sec 3 students to broaden their learning experiences and increase their exposure to courses at the post-secondary educational institutes. This in turn enables them to discover their interests and make informed education and career choices.</li>

Through the above initiatives and programmes, we aim to nurture well-rounded individuals who are resilient individuals, passionate learners, and active contributors. We encourage the stakeholders to actively work alongside us, whether it is through volunteering, attending school events or participating in the parent engagement sessions.

Together, let’s work hand in hand to empower every Serangoon StaR to SHINE, for the growth of self and the good of others.
