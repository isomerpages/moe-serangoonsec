##### WHAT IS EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT? 

Aligned to the Ministry of Education’s Uplift Enhanced School Resourcing initiative, Educational Support aims to enable and empower our students to embody the school’s SHINE (Self-Directedness, Harmony, Integrity, ResilieNce and Excellence) values, and progress in their education. We focus on providing opportunities for all students, especially vulnerable learners who may require more support, to attain their fullest potential. 

To support our students, our school plans customised interventions that focus on instilling socio-emotional competencies. Our programmes also leverage on peer support and relationships, strong teacher-student relationships and positive learning experiences to nurture a caring and enabling environment for our students to flourish. 

##### WHAT ARE OUR PROGRAMMES? 

In our school, we plan a variety of programmes to engage different student profiles. Some key programmes are outlined below. 

###### I.	ORION STARS AFTER SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT 

The Orion StaRs After School Engagement programme strives to provide meaningful engagement for Lower Secondary students through:

<ul><li>Immersive and authentic learning experiences such as Learning Journeys and Values In Action projects

</li><li>Interest-based activities such as sports, arts and crafts and cooking.</li></ul>

These varied activities strengthen our students’ personal and socio-emotional learning (SEL) competencies as they learn to collaborate with one other. The programme also strives to help our students develop self-awareness as they discover personal strengths and interests.

###### II.	MENTORING PROGRAMMES 

Our school works closely with vendors and partners to curate mentoring programmes to support and nurture our Secondary 2 and 3 students. 

Leveraging significant adults as mentors, our students acquire key socio-emotional competencies in the aspects of self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making.  Experiential learning activities such as projects and outdoor learning journeys provide platforms for our students to showcase and strengthen their socio-emotional learning. 

###### III.	APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ApLM)

ApLM are enrichment modules that broaden the learning experiences of students and complement the secondary school curriculum with a focus on the practical application of knowledge. 

These modules provide our students with applied learning opportunities – learning that involves doing and applying, learning about the real world, and learning for life. 

Through ApLM, we hope that our students will discover their interests and strengths, which would inspire them in making informed education and career choices.
