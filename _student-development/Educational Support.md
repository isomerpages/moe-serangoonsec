#### EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT in SSS

Educational Support aims to enable and empower our students to embody the school’s SHINE (Self-Directedness, Harmony, Integrity, ResilieNce and Excellence) values, and progress in their education. We focus on providing opportunities for our students, especially learners who may require more support, to attain their fullest potential. 

To support our students, our school plans customised interventions that focus on instilling socio-emotional competencies. Our programmes also leverage peer support and relationships, strong teacher-student relationships and positive learning experiences to nurture a caring and enabling ecosystem for our students to flourish.

##### KEY EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME

To effectively cater to the diverse needs of our student profiles, we implement a variety of targeted programmes as outlined below.

**I. ORION STARS AFTER SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT**
<br>The Orion StaRs After School Engagement programme strives to provide meaningful engagement for Lower Secondary students through:<br>
<br>•	Immersive and authentic learning experiences such as Learning Journeys and Values In Action projects
<br>•	Interest-based activities such as sports, arts and crafts and cooking.

These varied activities strengthen our students’ personal and socio-emotional learning (SEL) competencies as they learn to collaborate with one other. The programme also strives to help our students develop self-awareness as they discover personal strengths and interests.
