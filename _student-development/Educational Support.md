#### EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT in SSS

Educational Support aims to enable and empower our students to embody the school’s SHINE (Self-Directedness, Harmony, Integrity, ResilieNce and Excellence) values, and progress in their education. We focus on providing opportunities for our students, especially learners who may require more support, to attain their fullest potential. 

To support our students, our school plans customised interventions that focus on instilling socio-emotional competencies. Our programmes also leverage peer support and relationships, strong teacher-student relationships and positive learning experiences to nurture a caring and enabling ecosystem for our students to flourish.

##### KEY EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME

To effectively cater to the diverse needs of our student profiles, we implement a variety of targeted programmes as outlined below.

**I. ORION STARS AFTER SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT**
<br>The Orion StaRs After School Engagement programme strives to provide meaningful engagement for Lower Secondary students through:<br>
<br>•	Immersive and authentic learning experiences such as Learning Journeys and Values In Action projects
<br>•	Interest-based activities such as sports, arts and crafts and cooking.

These varied activities strengthen our students’ personal and socio-emotional learning (SEL) competencies as they learn to collaborate with one other. The programme also strives to help our students develop self-awareness as they discover personal strengths and interests.

*From creating bubble tea to challenging friends in Jenga, students discover new interests while building teamwork and confidence.*

**II. MENTORING PROGRAMMES**
<br>The school works closely with our partners to curate mentoring programmes to support and nurture our Secondary 2 and 3 students. These significant adults mentor and support the holistic development of these students.<br>
<br>Through one-on-one and group interactions, students organically acquire key socio-emotional competencies in the aspects of self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making.<br>
<br>The dedicated attention and positive relationships with the mentors help students feel seen, supported, and connected. This positive and trusting relationship contributes to a stronger sense of belonging and psychological safety within the school environment. The support structure not only enhances academic motivation but also acts as an essential safeguard for their overall well-being and resilience.<br>
<br>Leveraging significant adults as mentors, our students acquire key socio-emotional competencies in the aspects of self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making. Experiential learning activities such as projects and outdoor learning journeys provide platforms for our students to showcase and strengthen their socio-emotional learning.
