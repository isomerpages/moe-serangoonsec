### MOE Sexuality Education in Schools

Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.

The **Goals** of Sexuality Education are to:

(a)	Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.

(b)	Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

(c)	Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.

The **Key Messages** of Sexuality Education are:

(a)	Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;

(b)	Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);

(c)	Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and

(d)	Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

**Sexuality Education Lessons**

The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.  Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.

Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.

**eTeens Programme:**

eTeens is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. eTeens is conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.

Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.

**At SERANGOON Secondary School, the eTeens programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:**



| Topics/Lessons | Programme Learning Objectives | Time Period (e.g. Term 3 Week 9) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Mass Talk delivered through a pre-recorded video | Raise awareness and provide knowledge on: | Term 3 Week 7 |

|  | b)	Managing relationships and risky situations in a healthy way. |  |
| Classroom-based Lesson | Learn to negotiate their way out of a risky situation by applying skills of assertiveness and responsible decision-making | Term 3 Week 8 |
