Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students as Resilient Individuals, Passionate Learners, and Active Contributors. We aspire to see Serangoon StaRs thrive - as individuals, and as an integral part of their community. 

In Serangoon Secondary School, we are committed to empower Serangoon StaRs to SHINE by developing in them
<ul><li>Good character,
</li><li>Resilience and social-emotional well-being,
</li><li>Future readiness, and
</li><li>Active citizenship;</li></ul>
for the growth of self and good of others. 

We adopt an integrated and holistic approach, anchored on MOE’s philosophy of Character and Citizenship Education and our school’s SHINE values &amp; level themes, enacting CCE intentionally through

<ul><li>CCE lessons, comprising content areas such as National Education, Sexuality Education, Family Education, Mental Health, Education &amp; Career Guidance and Cyber Wellness
</li><li>Co-Curricular Activities
</li><li>School-based and cohort initiatives e.g. level camps &amp; workshops, applied learning electives, learning journeys, etc. 
</li><li>National Education (NE) events
</li><li>Student Leadership Development Programme (SLD)
</li><li>Values-In-Action (VIA)</li></ul>

Serangoon StaRs are engaged in experiential learning, and put into practice values and social emotional competencies taught. We envision a deepening of their learning and broadening of their spheres of influence, as they grow from

<ul><li>Understanding and Leading Self;
</li><li>Understanding Others and Working Together;
</li><li>Impacting and Inspiring Others; to
</li><li>Striving for Excellence and Looking Ahead.</li></ul>

A comprehensive Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme can have a positive impact on the quality of students’ educational and career decisions, and also on their education performance and the overall climate of the school (Lapan, Gysbers &amp; Sun, 1997).

ECG is strongly emphasized in Serangoon Secondary School. Serangoon StaRs discover their strengths and interests, and explore their goals and aspirations through the Curriculum, Cohort ECG Experiences, and other school experiences. Students are given the opportunity to participate in talks, workshops, learning journeys and attachment experiences to learn about various Institutes of Higher Learning, industries, and careers. 
Serangoon StaRs learn to proactively manage their individual pathways to success, and are encouraged to have regular conversations with their teachers on their education and career aspirations and plans. Our ECG Counsellor, Ms Juan, provides timely advice and guidance as well as customised ECG support. Comprehensive guidance and coaching are also provided for the various Application Exercises. 

It takes a village to raise a child. We warmly invite you - parents, alumni, other stakeholders and members of the public - to partner with us to enhance and enrich the school experiences for our Serangoon StaRs. 

We look forward to your support and partnership.
