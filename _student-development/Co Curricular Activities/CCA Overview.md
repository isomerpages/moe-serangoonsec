### Co-Curricular Activities

Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) provide an important platform in developing students' talents and interests. They play an important role in providing an all-rounded education. Our students are given many opportunities to discover their potential and achieve value-added performance. The commendable achievements of the school in CCAs have led our students to believe in their capacity to excel. This strong belief in their talents and abilities is an important mindset for the 21st century.

CCAs enrich students' school experience immensely. Through sustained participation, they develop passion, leadership, teamwork, friendship, and a sense of belonging. The values and social-emotional competencies cultivated through active participation in CCAs are important in overcoming future challenges. This is the reason why we provide a good range of CCAs to cater to the diverse needs of pupils.
