### Sowing The Seeds Of Kindness

Vegetables grow in the tiered hydroponic system while a wealth of flowers and herbs thrive in the garden. It is instinctive to draw a parallel between nurturing plants to fruition and guiding teenagers to maturity. After all, both processes require time, energy and effort.

“It’s so fun! Being able to grow plants and watch them become bigger before tasting them,” says Ina, a regular volunteer at the garden. Indeed, it is heartening to watch green spots swell and redden into fruits.  

In Serangoon Secondary School, all Secondary One students have a class plot to grow whatever they like. Some classes have chosen to grow vegetables like lady’s fingers and green beans. Others have chosen hardy plants like the Japanese roses and aloe vera. The fruits of their labour are given to families in need, elderlies and school support staff.

Yasarah, a Secondary One student, enjoys the sense of accomplishment from growing vegetables and appreciates being able to help people at the same time. “It’s so relaxing to look after these plants as well!” The benefits of gardening is manifold.

Students also get to take a look at various plants in the garden – including important cash crops like cotton - as well as understand the mechanism of the hydroponic farm. “Now I realise how important it is to treasure what we eat. It isn’t easy to grow all these vegetables. We have to sow the seeds, water them, prune regularly and look out for pests. I really appreciate how to grow food especially in the little red dot which is our home,” says Jun Han.

Joey, after attending a Geography lesson, enthuses, “It is really interesting to measure temperatures at various spots in the school.” Through this activity, students gain a deeper appreciation on how various materials retain ambient heat.

Not only do students learn more about more about scientific principles, they also get to ponder about wider issues regarding food security. Hence, students are able to situate their learning in familiar contexts. It is heartening to watch students grow even as they watch their plants grow.
