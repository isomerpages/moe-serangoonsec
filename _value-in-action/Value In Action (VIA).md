### Values in Action (VIA)

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community.

The VIA Programme is an integral part of the Serangoon Secondary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). Students plan and participate in diverse VIA activities that are designed to progressively develop students’ leadership and influence.

Through the VIA Programme, Serangoon StaRs

-       practice perspective-taking and develop empathy,

-       learn and apply life skills and leadership principles,

-       grow in their sphere of influence, and reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.
