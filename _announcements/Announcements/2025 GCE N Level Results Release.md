### VP Marc's Address to Graduating Students Receiving Their 2025 N Level Results

Good morning students, teachers, and parents,

Today is an important day. In a few moments, you will receive your N Level results. These results reflect the effort you have put in over the past few years, especially during times when learning was not easy.

Some of you may feel proud and relieved. Others may feel nervous or disappointed. Whatever you are feeling, it is okay. I want you to remember this: your results do not define who you are.

They are not the end of your journey. They are simply a pause point, a moment for you to reflect and decide your next step.

**Focus on What You Can Control**

Life will not always go according to plan. But there are things you can control, and these are linked closely to our school values.

**Self-Directedness:** Take responsibility for your next step. Ask questions, explore your options, and make choices that suit your strengths and interests.

**Integrity:** Be honest with yourself about where you are now and what you need to improve. Growth begins with honesty.

**Resilience:** If your results are not what you hoped for, do not give up. Setbacks do not mean failure. They mean you are still learning.

**Excellence:** Whatever pathway you choose next, aim to do your best. Excellence is not about being better than others, it is about being better than you were yesterday.

**Harmony:** Respect and support one another. As you move on to different paths, remember to stay kind, grateful, and connected to the people who helped you along the way.

These values will matter far more than any grade on a results slip.

**Your Next Steps**

After today, you will move on to different pathways. Some of you may go on to Poly, some to ITE, and some to other programmes. Every pathway is a meaningful one if it helps you grow and move forward.

There is no single “right” route. What matters is choosing a path that fits you and committing yourself fully once you are there.

Talk to your teachers. Talk to your parents. Seek advice, ask questions, and make informed choices.

**Gratitude**

To our parents, thank you for your patience, encouragement, and belief in your children, especially during difficult moments.

To our teachers and staff, thank you for guiding, supporting, and caring for our students, not just academically but as young people finding their way.

**What Truly Matters**

As you step into the next phase of your journey, remember that success is built over time. It comes from staying true to your values, learning from mistakes, and continuing to grow.

Carry with you the habits you have learned here: taking responsibility for your learning, treating others with respect, acting with honesty, bouncing back from setbacks, and striving to do your best.

In closing, your N Level results are one step, not your final destination. The road ahead is yours to shape. Move forward with confidence, purpose, and belief in yourself.

All the best, and thank you.
