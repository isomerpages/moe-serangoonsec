##### Travel Declaration for 2022 Mid-Year Holidays

2022-05-04

Dear Parent/Guardian,  
  
To ensure schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make **a travel declaration for your child/ward only if he/she intends to travel** for the mid-year holidays.

Please declare your child/wardâ€™s travel plan(s) for the holidays **by 27 May 2022 (Friday)**.  If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the holidays, **no action is required** on your side.  Please refer to the attached letter for details.

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe
