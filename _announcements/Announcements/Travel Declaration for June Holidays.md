### Travel Declaration for June Holidays
2021-05-14

Dear Parent/Guardian,

MOH has advised Singapore residents to defer all travel overseas, unless it is permissible under the prevailing MOH travel advisory.

To ensure schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration for your child/ward only if he/she **intends to travel** for the June holidays. NIL return is not required.

Please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s) for the June holidays by 21 May 2021 (Friday). We encourage you to do so via the Parents Gateway (PG) app (refer to [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)). If you do not have access to Parents Gateway (PG), you may do so using the attached hardcopy [click here](/files/SSS_Travel%20Declaration%20for%20June%202021%20Holidays_Hardcopy%20Ltr%20to%20Parents%20and%20Guardians.pdf) .  Your child/ward can submit to the FTs or General Office.

If your child/ward is travelling, please indicate clearly both the country and city of travel. Only one parent is required to declare.

When planning your travel, please refer to the attached advisory on travelling [click here](/files/Advisory%20on%20Travel%20June%202021.pdf).  If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school directly by contacting Ms Hazlin or Ms Serene at Tel: 63851589.

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
