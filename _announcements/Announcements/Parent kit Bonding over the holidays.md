### Parent Kit - Bonding Over The Holidays

Dear Parents/Guardians, 

With your children on a month-long break from school during this period of Phase 2A (Heightened Alert), there are still plenty of things you can do to bond as a family and your children to be engaged meaningfully. In this issue of Parent Kit, we have included suggestions on virtual visits to museums, nature parks, and provided cooking recipes for you to keep your young ones meaningfully occupied while also helping them discover and develop their interests! There are also simple tips to help you guide your children to stay positive, curious, connected, and independent. The latest issue of Parent Kit is available [here](/files/Parent%20Kit_Bonding%20Over%20the%20Holidays_.pdf).

If you would like other parenting tips, do check out the [web link](https://www.moe.gov.sg/parentkit) for past issues of Parent Kit. Thank you!
