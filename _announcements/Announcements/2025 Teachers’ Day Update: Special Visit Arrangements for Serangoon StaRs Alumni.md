Dear Serangoon StaRs Alumni,

We hope this message finds you well. As we approach Teachers’ Day, we want to inform you that, due to a tight schedule on Teachers’ Day Celebration (4 Sept), we will not be able to accommodate visits from ex-students on this special day.
We are heartened to know that some of you have expressed the desire to express your gratitude to your former teachers. You may do so by making appointments during Term 4 Week 1 with your teachers. This will allow for a more meaningful interaction.

Please remember to come dressed in appropriate attire that aligns with our school’s dress code and expectations of behavior. You are required to report accordingly at the guardhouse and when granted access to school, do wait at the foyer or General Office for the teacher whom you have made appointment with to meet you. For security reasons, please do not enter the other areas of school premises. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

Thank you.
