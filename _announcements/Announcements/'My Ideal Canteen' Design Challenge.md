![](/images/Announcements/Canteen_Design_Challenge_Poster_2024.png)

#### Terms and Conditions

**1. Welcome to ‘My Ideal Canteen’ Design Challenge!**
<br>This initiative is fully sponsored by the School Advisory Committee (SAC).

**2. Challenge Period**
<br>The challenge will be open from 1 July 2024 to 25 October 2024 (5pm).

**3. Eligibility**
<br>The challenge is open to all Serangoon Stars. You may enter the contest as an individual or as a team. 

**4. Design Challenge Background**
<br>Canteen has undergone little changes since the school opened in 2000. Hence, it is time to refresh the canteen. We believe this is a golden opportunity for you, our StaRs, to express your strong sense of identity and belonging to the school by actively contributing to the change you would like to see in the school. Come forward, Be part of the change!

**5. Design Challenge Brief**
<br>The challenge is to redesign our school canteen and re-think how the existing canteen space should, or could, function as a vibrant and healthy space. Your design should contain all the elements present in a typical school canteen – seating space for users, utensils return area, washing area, waste disposal and recycling points. You should also consider sustainability issues and the environmental impact of your design.

\We have given a five steps design process that you may use as a guide to complete your design work.

**5.1 - Overview**

**a.** 	The first step of the design process involves thinking about the big picture.  It’s where you define and state the problem you are trying to solve. You will need to really understand the problem that exists before chasing after solutions.  How is the school canteen designed now?  Start by making notes about what’s working and what isn’t working with the existing design.

**b.** 	Next, write and post a statement about who are the people that have the need for a new design?  How long has this situation been around?

**c.** 	Then write and post a short, but clear, success statement.  How will you know if you have a successful solution when you are done?  When you are nearly finished with your design, you can go back to this success statement to see if your design has met the criteria, you first proposed.

**5.2 - Collection of Information**

In this step of the design process, you try to gather as much information as possible about the existing canteen, along with the students and staff who use it.  You can't propose new solutions until you figure out what the existing problems are. You may use the following as a checklist:

**a.**	How many students need to be seated in the canteen during the recesses?

**b.**	What types of furniture is used in the existing canteen? Does it need to be movable? 	Why or why not?

**c.**	Interview students and staff about what they like and dislike about the existing canteen. What changes would they make to the space if they had a choice?

**d.**	Make a list of those features that you really like about how the canteen looks and functions.

**e.**	Make a separate list of all the not-so-well-designed features (tables and chairs may be uncomfortable etc).

**f.**	Calculate the number of students who eat in the canteen each day. How many recess periods does the school have? Consider how this information will affect your design.

**g.**	Does the redesigned canteen need to look like the typical canteen with long rows of tables? 

**5.3 - Brainstorm Ideas**

In this step of the design process, you put some early ideas down on paper. You may use the following as a checklist:

**a.**	Go online and research to determine good / bad examples of how eating spaces are designed. What inspires you?

**b.**	Gather all your notes from your interviews and post a summary of the results.

**c.**	Make a list of all the unique spaces and features you plan to have in the canteen.

**5.4 - Develop Solutions**

In this step, your rough ideas come together with drawings or models that can show others your solutions for a new canteen. You may use the following as a checklist:

**a.**	Create a hand drawn or digital model of your early ideas. 

**b.**	Show your ideas to your teachers and peers for some feedback. You can also review your progress with the group you may have interviewed and test whether your design would meet their needs or address their concerns. Learn from the feedback you receive and incorporate into your final design solution.

**c.**	Going through a detailed design process requires time to gather information, develop ideas, and make improvements. Design submissions that are researched, developed, and well executed will always stand out!

**5.5 - Final Design**

In the final step of the design process is to create finished drawings that illustrate your ideas to others. Remember, your explanation text, and the types of drawings you share need to tell the entire story of your project. You may use the following as a checklist:

**a.**	Review your design and test it against your original success statement that you wrote for the Overview. Does it meet this criterion?

**b.**	Does your final design meet the expectations of the students and staff that you interviewed?  If not, you may need to go back to the drawing board and revise your design.

**c.**	For your final design you will want to write and post a short but effective paragraph of the unique solutions you developed.  Tell us about your ideas.

**d.**	Your evaluators will be looking for these things:

<br>i.	Originality in your design.
<br>ii.	Your ability to creatively solve the design challenge.
<br>iii.	The quality of drawings you have submitted.
<br>iv.	How well you have written and explained your thinking behind the design.

**6. - Design Guidelines**

Here are some guidelines you must follow when designing the canteen space:

a.	It must be a versatile space, functioning as a dining area during recess hours and transforming into a study space during after-school hours.

b.	The space must be optimised to accommodate all the students during recesses. Therefore, besides the usual sit-and-eat arrangement, you may propose ideas for stand-and-eat section. 

c.	Create an open layout that allows for easy movement and a sense of spaciousness. It must not be enclosed or air-conditioned but naturally ventilated, supported by fans. 

d.	Furniture proposed must be safe, comfortable, sturdy, durable, not too heavy, and easy to maintain.

e.	A single table must accommodate minimally a group of 6 students or staff.

f.	Natural elements, such as potted plants can be added to bring life to the canteen space.

g.	Artwork on walls can be considered to add character to the canteen.

**7. - Submission Requirements**

<br>a.	All entries must be submitted by 5pm on 25 October 2024 to the school email: Serangoon_ss@moe.edu.sg
<br>b.	File size must not exceed 20MB.
<br>c.	All entries can either be hand crafted or digitally drawn and must be in colour.
<br>d.	All entries must be accompanied with a write-up explaining the design concept (minimum 250 words).   
<br>e.	School will accept up to 2 entries per person/ team.
<br>f.	By submitting the entries, you agree to Serangoon Secondary School using the design ideas in whole or in part to renovate the canteen.

**8.	Evaluation of Entries**

<br>a.	A panel of judges comprising School Leaders, School Advisory Committee Representatives and selected teachers will evaluate the entries.
<br>b.	Designers of the shortlisted entries will be required to make a presentation to the panel of judges explaining their ideas. 

 
**9.	Awards**
<br>All participants will be presented with a certificate of participation. The designers of the 12 winning entries will be awarded trophies and vouchers.
