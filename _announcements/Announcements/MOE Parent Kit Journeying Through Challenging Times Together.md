### MOE Parent Kit - Journeying Through Challenging Times, Together

Dear Parents/Guardians,

We go through both ups and downs with our children. What matters most is that we are there to journey with them - whether it be celebrating with them in their moments of joy or listening and empathising with them when they face challenges.

It is not easy as a parent with our multiple roles and responsibilities to take time to reach out to our children and understand what they are going through. But it makes a difference to them when we do it. Our children need a listening ear, to have a source of support and someone to rely on, and as parents, we can play an important part in meeting those needs!
