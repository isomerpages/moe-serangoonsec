### MOE: Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) from 19 May 2021 to 28 May 2021 for primary, secondary, JC and MI students

Dear Parents/Guardians,

With the sharp increase in the number of community cases, including the spike in unlinked cases on 16 May 2021, there is a need to reduce interactions and avoid the risk of large clusters. As such, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will be stepping up precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of all students and staff.

All primary, secondary, junior college (JC) and Millennia Institute (MI) students will shift to full Home-Based Learning (HBL) from 19 May 2021 (Wednesday) till end of term on 28 May 2021 (Friday).

During the full HBL phase, schools will provide instructions and support for students to access a range of both online and hardcopy HBL materials, so that learning continues uninterrupted. The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform will continue to be accessible to students. Students who require digital devices or internet access may contact their schools for assistance. Teachers and school personnel will keep in regular contact with students and parents to provide support.

The mid-year GCE O- and A-Level Mother Tongue Language examinations will proceed as planned and with strict Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.

Thank you. Together, we can overcome this. Stay safe!
