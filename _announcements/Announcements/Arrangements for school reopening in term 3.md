### MOE: Arrangements for school reopening in Term 3 for primary, secondary, JC and MI students

Dear Parents/Guardians,

As Singapore moves into Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) with gradual easing of community Safe Management Measures (SMMs), the Ministry of Education (MOE) will progressively bring students back to school after the June holidays.

To ease into full resumption of school when Term 3 starts on 28 June 2021, students from primary, secondary, JC and MI will return to school according to the following arrangements: 

<br> <br>

*  From Monday, 28 June 2021, Primary 4 to 6, Secondary 3 to 5, and all JC/MI students will return to school.
*  Secondary 1 and 2 students will be on Home-Based Learning (HBL) till Wednesday, 30 June 2021, and will          return to school from Thursday, 1 July 2021.
*  Primary 1 to 3 students will be on HBL for the first week (28 June to 2 July 2021), and schools will continue to       provide instructions and support for students to access online and hardcopy HBL materials.
*  All levels of students will return to school from Tuesday, 6 July 2021 onwards. (Monday, 5 July 2021, is a school holiday).

MOE Kindergartens and school-based Student Care Centres will resume fully from 28 June 2021 to facilitate care arrangements.

Schools will continue to ensure that SMMs are in place to keep our students safe. Students should also have their TraceTogether token or app with them throughout the school day to facilitate contact tracing. Parents are to keep their children at home if they or other household members are unwell with flu-like symptoms. They can return to school if their household members are tested negative for COVID-19.

Please see the [MOE Press Release](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20210614-arrangements-for-schools-and-institutes-of-higher-learning-under-phase-3-heightened-alert) for more information on the school reopening arrangements.

Thank you. Together, we can make schools a safe place!
