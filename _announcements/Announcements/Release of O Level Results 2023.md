Dear 2022 4E5N students, hope that you are spending your holidays meaningfully thus far. :)

The O-Level results will be released **tomorrow (12 January 2023)**.

Please take note of the following:

<ul>a) Reporting time: <b>1.50pm</b></ul>

<ul>b) Venue: <b>Hall</b></ul>

<ul>c) Reporting attire: <b>Half uniform with school pants/skirt with black shoes and socks</b></ul>

<ul>d) Please be properly groomed <b>(i.e. NO outlandish or inappropriate hairstyles)</b></ul>

**Note:** Students who are not properly groomed will experience delay in the collection of results at a separate area.

If you are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result, you should NOT return to school. Please inform your FTs. You can access your results from the Singapore Examination and Assessment Board's candidate portal with you have a SingPass account. 

Should your Singpass PIN be expired, you can reset your password instantly online or request for a new PIN mailer via Singpass website (www.singpass.gov.sg). For international students, SEAB will send a system-generated username to your email address a few days before the results release.

Your parent/guardian can accompany you to school to collect your results but they will be seated separately from you in the hall. Kindly remind them to park at 475 Upper Serangoon Crescent MSCP if they are driving due to limited parking space in the school, please. Thereafter, they can enter school via rear gate after crossing overhead bridge. Thank you for their understanding and support.

Do let us know if you have any queries. Take care and see you in school tomorrow. :)
