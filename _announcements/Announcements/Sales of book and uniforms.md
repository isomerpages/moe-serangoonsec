### Sale of Books and Uniforms

29 October 2021

  

Dear Parents/Guardians,

**SALE OF BOOKS AND UNIFORMS** 

We wish to inform you on the arrangements for the sale of books and uniforms as you prepare your child for the new school year in 2022.  

  

In view of the COVID-19 situation, it is imperative to minimize presence and intermingling of vendors / parents / guardians / students in school premises.  As such, we seek your understanding that the sale of books and uniforms will go **fully online** via the respective vendors’ website (see below) with \*home delivery as the preferred option. 

**Appointed vendor for Books (including stationeries, shoes & socks): Shing Lee Bookstores Pte Ltd**

Note: Last day for online order is **7 December 2021**.  

  

**Appointed vendor for Uniforms (including PE attire and name tag): In-Trend Uniforms**

##### SELF COLLECTION OF BOOKS

**Parents/guardians who prefer self-collection of books may order online and opt for self-collection. Please note the following:**

*   Self collections will be managed through Shing Lee’s online appointment booking system.
*   Self collections will be strictly for students/parents with confirmed appointments. 
*   Appointments for collection are offered in hourly slots with first appointment from 9am to 10am and last appointment from 2pm to 3pm.

*   Walk-in (without prior appointment) is strictly not allowed. 
*   Only 1 adult can accompany the student into the school premises.  
*   All visitors are required to enter school through the Front Gate only and adhere to the safe management measures: <br>
*   Security officers will verify your appointment before allowing entry.
*   Perform SafeEntry and temperature-taking at the Guard House.
*   Wear your face masks throughout.
*   Observe safe distancing. 
*   Students returning to school are required to be properly attired (minimally in half-school uniform with black shoes and socks).  Students who are not properly-attired will be refused entry.    <br>
