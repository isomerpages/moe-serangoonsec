##### Arrangement for Schools After Circuit Breaker
Dear Parent/Guardian,

With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020, in a careful and safe manner. From 2 June 2020, our graduating students and students who need additional support will return to school daily. The other levels will rotate weekly between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons. The school will ensure that safe management measures are in place to keep our students safe. Click on the [attachment](/files/SSS%2020200521%20Arrangement%20for%20Schools%20After%20Circuit%20Breaker.pdf) for more details on the measures and arrangements.

Our teachers will continue to monitor the progress of your child and be in regular contact with you and your child to provide support during this transition. MOE will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. We urge you to rely on official sources of information and not to circulate any unconfirmed information. If you have any further queries, please contact 6385 1589.

Thank you.

##### 2020 End-of-Term 2 Letter to Parents and Guardians
Dear Parents/Guardians,

As we reach the end of Term 2, we are glad to share with you that Semester 1 concluded well despite the evolving COVID-19 challenges. As announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE), with the revised academic calendar, schools will make provisions for graduating cohorts as well as students who need greater support to return to school during the upcoming May school holidays.

Our end-of-Term 2 letter to parents is attached for your information. In this letter, we also provide resources on engaging your child/ward during School Holidays@Home. Take care and stay safe!
