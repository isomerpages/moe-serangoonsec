On the morning of 27 October, we came together as a school to close the 2023 academic year, and bid a reluctant farewell to our Vice-Principal, Mr Sebastian Jin. Mr Jin will be posted out in December as part of the rotation posting of VPs. 

In the words of our Principal, Mr Chen: "Mr Jin takes professional pride in carrying out his duties and has been a great support in inducting me into the Serangoon family in my first year as Principal".

Thank you, Mr Jin, for 6 years of dedicated service and supportive leadership. You have been an inspirational school leader – with the remarkable ability to make everyone feel heard, valued and included. 

You will be greatly missed, but your legacy will live on in the countless lessons and values you’ve imparted to students and staff of Serangoon Secondary. 

Adieu, and best wishes for the journey ahead!
