### Travel Declaration for Year-End Holidays (2021)

Dear Parent/Guardian,

  

To ensure schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make **a travel declaration for your child/ward only if he/she intends to travel** for the year-end holidays. 

  

Please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s) for the Year-End holidays by **29 October 2021 (Friday)**. We encourage you to do so via the Parents Gateway (PG) app (refer to [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)). If you do not have access to Parents Gateway (PG), you may do so via (a) online via [FormSG](https://form.gov.sg/6142fc184a4bca0012047e4e) or using the attached hardcopy [click here]([](/files/SSS_Hardcopy%20Letter%20to%20Parents%20and%20Guardians%20Not%20Using%20PG%20-Year%20End%202021.pdf)) which your child/ward can submit to the FTs or General Office.

If your child/ward is travelling, please indicate clearly both the country and city of travel. Only one parent is required to declare. 

  

If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the year-end holidays, **no action is required** on your side.

  

When planning your travel, please refer to the attached advisory on travelling [click here]([](/files/Advisory%20on%20Travel%20-%20Year%20End%202021.pdf)).  If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school directly by contacting Ms Hazlin or Ms Serene at Tel: 63851589. 

  

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
