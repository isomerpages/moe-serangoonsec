This year, a team of 13 Secondary 4 StaRs took part in the Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO). Held for secondary school students, the SJPO is aimed at encouraging the study and appreciation of physics beyond the school curriculum. This annual competition provides opportunities for students to solve novel physics problems that require critical and inventive thinking.

We are proud to announce that six of our StaRs who participated were awarded an Honourable Mention in at least one category, while four of our StaRs were awarded Honourable Mention in both the team and individual categories.

Well done to all the participants!
